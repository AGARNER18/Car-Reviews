2007,Honda,Civic,"Great car, looks good, sounds good and saves gas for the performance it gives. I like that they add some luxury into it and they added Voice Command and Navigation system. Easily up-gradable car with higher performance parts to increase power. Very reliable, and not so costly to maintain or repair.","Sport/fun (spirited driving, track racing, off-roading, etc.)"
2009,Honda,Accord,"engine mang.system does not work right, honda says there is nothing wrong, then they come back and say yes there are reports of the issues i talk of. BUT they cant fix it or wont cause that says YES there is something wrong...CANT say that can you honda, just so many things wrong with this car there is a tech bullet out on the brakes upgrade the rear pads can fix the sounds back there.A/C smells bad jerks at speed milage sucks our GMCyukon suv got better than this HONDA!please do yourself a great justice DONT buy a accord and beware of colonial honda bad people bad bad people they tell you things and then dont follow through. I was a true believer i worked and owned a towing company for over 20 years all i could talk about was how great honda was that was until i got one of my own, I am sorry i made honda look so good for so long when they have made their self look soooo bad in just a few miles...PLEASE DONT PUT YOURSELF THROUGH IT buy something else please.I went to the dealer asked for help they all but put their middle finger up at me and said it not our car anymore you deal with it sucker.... who's the sucker now HONDA....the internet is a great thing",
2009,Honda,Accord,"I just bought a new honda accord and it has been nothing but problems , I bought it for payment wrong move. This car feels so tinny and handles like a slug not to mention it sounds like a street bike and it has been to the shop numerous times for repairs which has been a bit troublesome, this car is truly bad news . I should have bought the Malibu or Fusion they were a bit more but now I see why they felt more safe and alot more responsive . Don't make my mistake . The American cars are even better and alot more are made here in the US with pride. It is a bit more but I should have thought ""Do u buy processed cheese from the dollar store or do you get the deli cheese from stop and shop"" ? I bought the 99 cent processed cheese that really is not cheese if you know what I mean . There is a general misconception that honda is better who do they pay off for there reviews ? Do they get a tarrif for all the cars they import from japan that are made dirt cheap . So people Does Japan make a better vehicle no not at all ! I was a cheap fool lol. Does anyone remember World War 2 Hello. Was it Japan that made the first automobile. I DONT THINK SO. The salesman at honda said "" honda has factories in the US"" ok .. Later I find out that Honda has very few plants in the US. Plus all the profits returm to Japan bottom line the destruction our economy from within . This Car buying experience was the worst ever ! I will never buy a Honda Again or any Japanese Car Again or any of these tinny unsafe, unreliable glorified pieces of ishh. Buy American there are better then ever ! I became a yuppy dont let it happen to you! Looks like I will be trading in my Honda as I write this blog I realize that I will take a massive lost from the value dropping and buy a real car Dont make my mistake ! Thanks and God Bless ...",
2009,Honda,Accord,"This has been a very satisfying purchase. I bought a manual sedan for nostalgia... I had a stick for 10 years in my 20's. I am NOT a ""Honda blogger"" I am a 53 year old wife and mom. We have been a Toyota family for ten years (Still love Toyotas) BUT, in need of a new car, did not need something similar to the Landcruiser it was replacing. I searched many months and was drawn to the Accord. First appeal was the Europen look. The base price of the Ex L included all that I would have wanted but at additional cost IF I bought a Toyota. It is deceptively roomy inside and has enough zip especially considering it is 4cyl..A good, solid, practical vehicle. Don't know what those other two reviews are talking about. They're wrong.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Its a great fun car with stunning looks and great MPG numbers.\nmy 2007 honda civic EX with 68000 miles still drives as good as other newer models. In my opinion, this model (8th Generation Civic) is still the BEST looking, even better the the new one.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This car is economical and is better than most for the environment. It handles well and the body and the interior are solid, though the upholstery particularly in the front is badly stained. The heating/cooling system is great. The sound system is good, and we appreciate the aux in. Overall the car is attractive. However, like other hybrids it is sluggish and lacks power particularly on hills.",Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,"It has the v6 automatic trans, which is an uncorfortable ride shifting in and out all the time ( the ecno mode is really annoying) the gas mileage is 16 if you are lucky in town and 22 on the road. The bucket seats suck for comfort and are no recaros
 The interior noise level is unbarable causing me to try to sound antunate the underside and trunk with not much suscess. I guess the raidos self adjustment to the noise level is thier answer, the radio adjusts itself louder as the faster you drive to cover for noise level. the heater seats are good for winter driving but the controls are in a very bad spot and are turned on unknowingly until your butt sweted up a puddle, the ride is extremly hard. The pluses for the car are it looks good, the power curve is increadble (v6) stearing wheel has good adjustment,
 Oh about the break problem that is a factory defect; I did get a settlement card that honda will pay for 121 bucks tward a break job neeeded at about 20 thousand miles. I currently have only 10,600 miles on the car and bought it new in 09 the brake problem is contrary to what honda is supposed to be about. In sumary I would not have purchased this car If I had the information I now have, I truly expected better mileage, my old buick got 19, this Honda 16 on a good day contary to the spec sheet. It is an uncomforatable car and aside form the good looks it is not a keeper. Sad but my 1st honda will be my last",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Replaced my 1995 Volvo GLT. Very nice car with firm, comfortable leather seats, very capable stereo and smooth utilitarian ride. The gas pedal-engine ""drive by wire"" interaction is my only complaint with occasional excessive revving and response. Overall I am very happy the the quality and value of my purchase. Time will tell about reliability.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"I leased a 2009 Honda Accord, I love all car manufacturers. All of them have their flaws. The Accord is a decent vehicle that is nicely appointed for its class. Only downside is that it is slightly large and handles like a boat. Other than that, I am 2000 miles or so in and have sqeaky brakes which they have attempted to fix with no luck. Good car for daily, mostly non-spirited driving. Good looks, clean lines. Comfortable. Additional cons, interior noise, loosely fitted ceiling panel, noisy at times.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"I am a ""retired"" amatuer & pro racer. Couldn't afford my usual choices of MB or BMW and Ford is even more expensive, NEVER saw such poor workmanship So I bought a Honda Accord Coupe V6 with a 6 Speed
 Manual, 18"" OZ made wheels, with fat Michelin Pilots. Every, I mean every, review and info, like here, says either a 5 Speed Manual, most say NO manual! Yes, they're rare, hard to get. The automatics feel like the old GM auto's constantly going in/out of lock up Torque Convertor. My 6 Speed is a Dream. The car is superb and handles like a Sport Benz or ""M"" BMW;s. At 27K a steal!",
2007,Honda,Accord,"I just recently leased a 2007 Honda Accord SE and I love it! I experienced by first Honda when I was given my mother's old car when I turned 16. (A 1993 Honda Accord EX - 2DR) At 136,000 miles that car was still going strong, so I didn't blink twice when I felt it was time to get a new car...Another Honda. First I considered the Civic; however, I felt it was smaller than what I needed. I love my new Honda, great gas mileage, stylish look, really spacious! The trunk is huge! The audio system and sound is great, my CD's sound awesome. Highly recommend.",
2007,Honda,Accord,"just shy of 94,000 miles, our one owner accord is still chugging along. car looks great for a 2007, and the paint quality is still that of a newer vehicle. the vehicle has slim lines, leaving minimal blind spots and an easy driving experience. the power drivers seat with lumbar support gives the proper about of knee and back support making for a comfortable commuter car. aside from regular maintenance, the car has been in the shop for a few unusual items, (master window switch, v-tech actuator, washer fluid motor) which didn't come at a cheap cost, and almost a little higher than most honda owners would probably expect. for a four cylinder, the car has good acceleration, tight handling, and a hefty breaking system, all making for an enjoyable driving experience with piece of mind.",Family transportation
2008,Honda,Element,"This is my second Element...the vehicle has served my life style both when I was younger and into sport activities and also now as I've aged. It is great for hauling bags of feed, building materials, etc. Medical issues force sale.","Utility (towing boats, transporting cargo, etc.)"
2008,Honda,Element,"I loved how the car makes you feel huge, meaning that the interior is spacious and head room is decent. Performance wise, the car is average but has power when it is needed. The only thing it needed was better gas mileage.",Family transportation
2009,Honda,Accord,Performance is as great as you can expect from a 2.4 L Engine which makes it fun to drive.\nQuality needs work. The carpeting in the interior tends to come out easily.\nAppearance is great. I love the interior and exterior look of this car.\nIt's pretty cheap to run this car in my opinion thus far.\nGreat car overall. Just wish the back seats folded down to create more cargo room.,The size and the fuel economy
2009,Honda,Accord,"Have yet to obtain the millage promised on sticker, around town or on the highway. Dealer said on board computer needed time to digest driving habits etc. With 11,000 miles, approximately 8-9000 have been interstate miles. 
 
 Interior arm rests of little value, neither are within reach to be comfortable and no adjustable center counsel. 
 
 Time will tell on total value.
 
 My old 6 cyl 93 Oldsmobile was a great car with better millage.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"A good, reliable car that is affordable and gets good gas mileage. Works well as a daily commuter vehicle. It is also a good small family car. Once your children get bigger you may want to look for something roomier.",Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,"It was my first Honda. I like everything about it. The mileage is even better than advertised (I don't push cars). It's very roomy, even in the back. So far it's perfect.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Honestly, my family has owned nothing BUT hondas. My mom had a 1989 Honda Accord that had about 300,000 miles on it and it still ran without error. She had about 4 Honda Accords after that. I have currently a 1994 Honda Civic with 166,000 Miles on it that no matter what will start for me everytime: Hot, Cold, Snow, Rain, doesnt matter. It also gets amazing gas milage (about 35 mpg highway) and a 10 gallon tank which makes gassing up a little less stressful. I have never had a huge mechanical problem with a Honda and neither has anyone else in my family. They are the most reliable cars you could ever buy. You could find a Honda civic being sold prvately on the side of the road with 135,000 miles on it and buy it with great confidence that it will be a great car. American cars suck completely. They arent reliable and once they hit almost 100,000 miles, they are falling apart. My mom has this new accord and let me tell you, its fashinable and beautiful. It has just enough power in the V4 for someone and gives an incredibly comfortable drive. It has amazing features including a great stock sound system. This new accord is the definition of luxury. Five Stars. I would highly recommend a Honda to anyone. A honda will NEVER let you down.",
2007,Honda,Accord,Most impressive is the fact that this vehicle has a lot of pep. The gas mileage is pretty good for a six cylinder and I especially like the heated seats in the winter. Handling is good and I have not had to do anything to it since I've had it. It is an extremely reliable vehicle. I previously had a mazda and the build quality of the Honda is solid and not flimsy. It has a sleek look and this car holds its value with all that's included.,Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Fit,a fun car to drive even though that the sport version is in a automatic transmission \ni like the style on the interior specially the steering wheel and the paddle shift \nmakes you feel that your in a exotic car like a Ferrrari!,Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"This is the second Odyssey we have owned. The first was a 1999 and we put well over 150K trouble free miles on it. We replace the original with this vehicle. This version is far more luxurious, better handling, braking, ride, and interior comfort. I know mini-vans are not ""Sexy"" but it is impossible to beat the versatility and reliability of this vehicle. I am continually amazed on how effortless it is to drive this car on highway. It cruises along at 80 mph without an issue and returning 28t mpg during long roadtrips.\nThis is a heavy vehicle and as such, the mpg suffers in city (stop & go) driving. Thankfully, we never had to do much of that in this car.",Interior space and comfort. This vehicle is ideal for roadtrips
2009,Honda,Accord,"I bought an Accord EX-L V6 in March 2009, coming out of a leased Audi A6 3.2 Quattro. I got a great deal on the Accord, about 1/2 what a new A6 would cost. OK, I spent 50% but got about 85%. Power and ride on the Accord is very good. The Accord's interior is OK; nobody beats Audi for interiors. The only area where I think Honda skimped on, noticably, is on sound insulation, a common Honda trait based on previous Honda ownership experience. I suppose it's inevitable as American Honda does not want to canibalize Acura sales. While not an A6, this is a satisfying car. Seems solid and hopefully will be reliable. Despite vaunted Honda reliability, we have replaced a transmission in an Odyssey, replaced broken motor mounts, had problems with the power doors. My A6 was near flawless in terms of reliability",
2009,Honda,Accord,"I just bought one of these junk boxes . I agree with the guy below this car is poorly designed. The american cars are really much better . I let my wife talk me into this car. I dont feel safe when the wind blows the car is all over the road.High gas mileage , I think they just cheaped out on the sheet metal and this thing is way to light. It is so funny to read the comments its like a BMW or Mercedes haha not even close more like a geo. How much does Honda pay those guys to blog? There shady tactics have finally caught up . Honda is junk has been and will always be . BUY AMERICAN these cars are not built in the US and none of the money they make stays in america.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Just bought an Accord coupe and am I sorry! I've had many different cars over the years starting with a 50 Plymouth. This is by far the worst vehicle I've ever had. Power window on drivers side wouldn't go back up, power lock on passenger side didn't work and the cruise control won't set, though the lights indicate it is engaged. Had to have service on the battery and now the radio is done for. Dealer failed to give me activation code. Said for $125 they could retrieve it for me. Duh! Went to Best Buy for a new radio (better than Honda's). A bit more than $125. Cost $225 total. Dealer and Honda lost a customer. Kia here I come!!!",
2007,Honda,Accord,"This is the second Accord I have purchased. I still own and use the first one I bought used back ********** 1997 Accord LX V6, no bells and whistles. I have NEVER had to put a dime into repairs for that car aside from regular maintenance and a new muffler, so you can guess why I went for another Accord as it's predecessor. The new Accord is much bigger and it's loaded with options--beautiful tan leather, wood trim, premium stereo system with XM radio and a 6-CD disc changer, moon roof. And can you say, ""Roomy""? Maximum passenger head and leg room, nice, big trunk. Handles like a dream too. Accelerates like a pro--this car has power. And it gets 30 mpg, pretty great for a powerful V6, and important these days. Clean air emissions car, so it is more environmentally friendly than several other makes and models. I am so happy with it--who needs to spend twice or three times as much on a Lexus, BMW, or Infiniti? I am driving in style! (Even though I kind of wish I had waited for the 2008--I like the body style better. If Honda would have released photos of the 2008 sooner I would have held out for one, damn it!)",
2007,Honda,Accord,very disappointing,
2008,Honda,Civic,"This car hasn't had a repair performed in 7 years and 70k of mixed driving. If this car had more road noise isolation it would be perfect. Easy ingress-egress, the driving position is great, controls are simple and well placed. Power is ok but at 38-40 mpg highway driving it strikes the perfect balance. It is as solid, rattle and squeak free as the day it was delivered. Handling is excellent. The interior is designed with high quality materials. The leather seats look new. I paid $23K for this car new and it's worth $10 to 11K today. For a small economical car I find it difficult to believe there's anything better.",Family transportation
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"This van doesn't drive like a minivan - \nit drives like a car! The handling is \nsecure and responsive, especially when \ncornering. Braking is smooth and the \nOdyssey never feels like it is ""getting \naway from me"" and it doesn't feel ""top-\nheavy"" around corners!\nAs for repairs? C'mon, it's a honda! \noil change, yes, repairs, no! It feels \nas solid as the day I first drove it.\nOn comfort, seven people fit with plenty \nof room with no teeth in kneecap feeling! \nWhat I love most is the versatility - I \ncan easily hide the third row seats for \nplenty of storage room - and can also \nremove one or both middle row seats to \nhave a true van to move large items!\nBest of all is how safe it feels! From \npower sliding doors to quick handling, \nthere is nothing more I want from my \nOdyssey - except, maybe, the dvd \nentertainment system! That is next time!\nWould I recommend an Odyssey? You \nBETCHA! As I said at the beginning, I \nfeel like I am driving a car, not a van! \nMy Odyssey proves that minivans don't \nhave to be boring - they can be fun on \nfour wheels! \nI've been driving an Odyssey for over a \nyear - it is the only minivan I found \nthat feels safe and is as easy to drive \nas a sedan. When the family group \noutgrows the small seven seaters - this \ncar is the absolute best!","Comfort, Safety, Ease in Driving"
2007,Honda,CR-V,I like how it tells you how many miles to the gallon you're getting as you are driving. The car has a lot of space in the front/back seats and the trunk. Its is very reliable and nice to have.,
2009,Honda,Accord,"Overall I really like this car, very low cost to maintain, very responsive and a great ride. I really enjoy how it handles, the overall gas mileage, and its power. The heated seats are always nice for the midwest winters.",Great gas mileage yet very quick and responsive
2009,Honda,Accord,"The kids who are bashing this car obviously have never owned one. I seriously doubt that they are even old enough to drive, based on the lack of logic and intelligence displayed. 
 
 Honda makes an outstanding product that I have personally used for the past 7 years, with no complaints. Can't say that about the four 'American' brand cars that I have owned. Sorry to say, but that's the truth. 
 
 I've served in the US military for over ten years, and obviously I love the US very much- I just won't buy any other vehicle besides a Honda. It's NOT patriotic or intelligent to buy an inferior vehicle that was assembled in Mexico or Canada, just because it has an American brand name. 
 
 My US-made Honda is more 'American' than your Canadian/Mexican-made Chevy!",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Just got mine and I love it! I got the most standard and it comes fully loaded! Fords, Chryslers and GMCs do not come with so many extras! It drives smoothly and it feels like a luxurious car!",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,Great family vehicle. Looks great inside. Love the reclining seats. Awesome storage all over great storage in back! Awesome gas mileage. Seats eight and drives smooth. Low maintenance is awesome. Reclining seats for carseats is a great plus! Every family should own an oddysey!,"Gas economy, comfort, style, storage"
2009,Honda,Fit,"I purchased this car new in Dec 2008 for the purposes of commuting to work 84 miles one way. It was fine for a few years, but I need something more comfortable now. This car is fine for someone that is driving in the city (on smooth roads), or short drives on the highway. The car is very attractive and sleek, but this look comes at a cost of an inefficient A/C on long trips in the summer. The biggest problem with this car is the awful ride with the low profile tires. You will feel every bump in the road. Never again will I get these kinds of tires on any vehicle. These wheels look 'cool', but ruin the ride.",Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,"I couldn't wait to see the brand new 2008 Honda Accord Coupe last November;2008. Saw pics from the German Auto Show, read great reviews and after a long test drive, I bought it and have had it for 1 year as of two weeks ago. Most people stop me and ask me how Honda came up with such an incredible coupe-thanks Honda Racing! With a top speed of 160, great manual shifting and in Black on black, beautiful interior and the EXL6 engine and loaded car; it's much more then I could ask for except a Porsche 911 at three times the price. Running and looking awesome!",
2008,Honda,Element,"Disappointing car. Handles pathetically poor in snow or wind (even slips on the occasional dry payment!). Seems spacious on the inside, but somehow nothing ever fits in it when I go to Home Depot. It says it's good for dogs, but that is not the case, unless you want them flying around inside or in a cage in the way back where you can't see them. Very loud inside, and there is absolutely not extras on this car. Sunroof in the back seat is a nice option, but it gets really hot back there since the back windows do not fully open.",Commuting to work
2007,Honda,Odyssey,Drove this van from Alaska to Florida and it never hiccupped. Minimal maintenance and only had to have recalls done to the vehicle. Getting ready to do the timing belt etc in the next year or so. It is the best car we've ever owned.,Most maintenance free car we've ever owned
2009,Honda,Civic,"I traded my v-8 truck in for my Civic, the gas money I saved going 60 miles one way alone paid my car payment. Never had any major issues with the car. would buy again, and again, and again!",Commuting to work
2008,Honda,Civic,"Excellence Style, good handling, mugen spoiler, mugen body kit, mugen wheel, mugen muffler. Best Honda Civic in the US ever. only 1000 made. If you can find one and you want it, go ahead and get it. You wont be disappointed.",
2008,Honda,Element,"I think the Element is the best of the ""BOX"" Utes (the others just tried to copy the ELMT) on the road. I personally like the 5 Spd trans over the Auto. Better MPG and control. The camping possibilities are outstanding. ""They"" even have a tent the Element can back into and leave while the tent stays in place.",Family transportation
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I like the way it handles curves rain or shines. it's a good looking car on the road, and in front of your house too. You get lot of stares of praise. This car is the most dependable car I have had until now.",Family transportation
2009,Honda,Accord,"My new 09 accord has squeaky brakes. Dealer say's Honda knew about this problem since the 08 accords. Nothing can be done. I wish they would of disclosed this to me before my purchase. But then, I wouldn't of bought the car. Other than that, the cars pretty nice.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Love the gas milage, the ease of repair and the super reliability of this model. Wish it had a leather seat option and it would be just about perfect.

2009,Honda,CR-V,We have put 83--- thousand miles on our CR-V in four years. It doesn't have a luxury car ride like our Lincoln. Still I love to drive it because it gets good gas mileage for a non-hybrid vehicle and the driving position is comfortable.,Family transportation
2008,Honda,Civic,"For a family sized sedan, Civics are stylish while being comfortable. It got me to Virginia and I was comfortable the entire time! They have little to no serious maintenance issues and only went to the shop to get routine oil changes. The money this car saved me in gas was incredible and most definitely saved me thousands of dollars after switching from an SUV. While not being incredibly sporty and fast, my Civic was a blast to drive and I would most definitely recommend these vehicles to anyone looking for a fun vehicle with great fuel economy.",Commuting to work
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Very comfortable for a 6'5"" man, lots of legroom in both front and back seats, huge cargo area and great MPG. With XM radio = fantastic for long, 1,000+ mile trips. I would recommend this car to anybody. Confirmed my belief in Honda.",Family transportation

2007,Honda,Accord,I am very unhappy with the Accord. My daughter was in a total loss accident and had to replace her car. She was torn between the Camry and Accord. Being a college student she has financial limits. She bought the Accord and may I say let the buyer beware. First it was our fault no doubt but she didnt learn til after the fact that there are NO rear speakers. Are you serious??? It is a 2007 Honda. I think an Escort at least has 4 speakers. Then the black interior. The cloth used is so cheap and lint hell. The console should at least be vinyl. It is the same velour and it grabs everything. She was so excited that she could afford a Honda. Now in hind sight. She would buy a Camry. I realize we should have explored our options further but the Honda name gave us false security. So much for a name!,
2009,Honda,Accord,"After buying my 2009 Accord I was really down that it is not the quality car I thought it was. I cannot get the local dealer to fix the things that I have asked to be fixed. Plastic rattles in the back of the car drive me crazy, the transmission almost doesn't shift from 1st to 2nd the first couple of times when the car is cold, the power seat has several rough bumps in it when moving forward or backward, the lights dim very noticeably at night when the AC cycles on and the AC does not wrok well sitting in traffic. The dealer says all of these things are normal and not to worry! I will not buy a Honda ever again and wish I had bought the Nissan!",
2007,Honda,Element,"This is the Swiss Army knife of the small SUV's. The SC suspension & cab upgrade were well worth it. Seperates it from the normal looking Elements! Handles like a Civic, enough engine to get you anywhere in a hurry! \nRowing thru the gears on the 5sp can get you into or out of trouble in a flash. I upgraded the brakes with and crossdrilled and slotted EBC's & Eibachs made this epic! \nThe awesomeness of the transformer back seats can't be matched. Two 6 footers, 200lb'ers sit in the back no problems.\nIt puts the FUN in functional! If the SC came in AWD I'd keep it forever!",Family transportation
2009,Honda,Accord,"I bought a 2009 Acord and have not come close to the fuel eonomy stated. I have averaged 16-17MPG in city and 22MPG on highway. Honda's reputation is about where GM;s was in the late 1970s - totally undeserved. The Accord is an ok car, but save some money and buy a Chevy - Better fuel efficiency and cheaper to own",
2009,Honda,Accord,"We have about 6,500 miles so far on the Accord. Mostly town road and freeway to work and school. It isn't getting the mileage we thought it would and my wife is not a hot rodder. We got 27.4 calculated on a 324 mile round trip to visit my wifes parents. Around town we get 17 - 19 mpg. We did better in a 5 year old Malibu Maxx V6 with 66,000 miles on it. 19- 22 city and 30 - 34 highway both calculated. Also, interior isn't as good as former Hondas we don't think. We had an 2000 Accord. Fit and finish is average inside and out, with an annoying rattle from somewhere. The dealer service department has been pushy and left dirt foot prints on the floor mats. We had driven a Saturn Aura and really liked it. Also drove a Camry and Nissan Altima. The Altima was nice but didn't feel comfortable or safe in it. She really liked the Saturn, but wanted a light, blue color that was not in stock at the time. My wife now regrets buying this Honda and says she would have rather bought a Saturn.",
2009,Honda,Element,i love that it was standard. the quality was awesome. the performance was speechless and the car was over all great. the cost of the owner ship was $200. this car was fun to drive this car is AWESOME i loved it.,Family transportation
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"Love the power and the handling on the people \nmover. No squeaks or rattles and looks good \ntoo.\nHave only been taking it for regular \nmaintenance so far.

2009,Honda,Accord,"Selling high line cars for 20 + years I tend to take things for granted. My wife is conservative so she came out of a Hyundai Sonata which she really liked ( so did i for the money) We lease so the Honda had a better lease this time. I got her an EX-L without Nav because for some crazy reason Honda deducts 2 percent from the residual for Nav ??? The car is nice but does not have garage door openers, no blue tooth, no memory seats and so so sound system ?? What is a loaded EX-L ? Glad its a lease and I will do my homework on her next car. Car also does not handle well around corners too soft lot of body roll. Quality is great though for long term owners!! The Mazda 6 is same price with all i wanted in it including over 300 watt bose system my neighbor just got one im sorry i didnt consider it stronger.",
2007,Honda,Element,Difficult to see out side windows with rear seats in the folder up position. Rear cargo area great with plenty of room. Very roomy in both driver and passenger area. Seats comfortable\nRear seats very easy to lay down or fold up for storage. .,Family transportation
2007,Honda,Accord,"Does not have Bose Audio System like some luxury cars do!! :( I have owned Accord 2007 SE for almost 7 years now and I love it! Adequate pick up, excellent mileage, not much wind/road noise, quite comfortable. Ride quality could be firm for some but I find it fine. Gas mileage is as advertised, in fact many times I exceed it. But then I have a very light foot! I do have reservation about 1 screens though! I don't understand why there are one small screens, which makes menu system unnecessarily complicated. I guess just one, little bit larger touch screen should suffice. Secondly, the audio system sucks! The sound quality is ridiculously bad. My decade old Toyota had a better sounding stereo!",Commuting to work
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"Overall an excellent family vehicle. Extremely user friendly, and convenient to use when you have two or more kids. Third row is a big plus. Maintenance is not very expensive but the MPG can be a little bit better. I love it for overall performance, looks, reliability.","Reliable, easy to drive, very convenient and spacious."
2007,Honda,Accord,"I really don't know why you would spend more money on just about any car. Purchased as a ""Certified"" car from local Honda dealer. This is our third Accord, so I guess that we like them.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"This is my first Honda and first foreign brand in
 many years. I have owned Datsun, Nissan, Toyota,
 and Saab in years past, and many American cars. My
 most recent car was a Buick Lucerne with the Northstar V8, leather, sunroof, etc.(which I liked)
 so I didn't want to step down too much. Both the 
 Buick and the Accord have spacious interiors. I liked the cushy seats in the Buick better, but the
 rear visability is much better in the Accord. Overall, the Accord is quite a good car. It does not
 feel small. The seating position is excellent.
 The 4 cyl engine and automatic transmission are 
 beautifully smooth and except under heavy acceleration,quiet. The 4 cyl could use a little more
 low end torque, ******** a zippy little engine and it
 makes the car fun to drive while being economical
 to operate. It cruises like a bear at 60 -80 mph
 with plenty of reserve power for passing. The body
 panels are a precision fit and the paint finish on
 mine (beige metallic) is the best of any car I've
 ever owned. The basics of the car like drivetrain,
 brakes,etc. are as good as it gets in this price range. The handling, maneuvability, turning radius,
 steering, are excellent. Traction on slick pavement is excellent, I have not experienced snow yet. The ride is a little choppy, as a trade-off to better, more stable handling, but it is very sure-footed and smooth at highway speed on good roads.
 
 Improvements could be made to reduce cabin and wind noise. A rain gutter over the windows would be nice. The carpet is a little thin. The seats are 
 pretty firm for us older folks. Steering wheel tilt/telescope could stand redesigning as well as
 matching/harmonizing with interior color better
 (only available in black). I don't like the plastic
 on the trunk lid (and I noticed it had yellowed on the white model I looked at), but I guess it has 
 purpose. I feel nitpicky - nothing's perfect.
 
 To summarize, these are very sharp cars representing
 good value and performance.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I've owned this car since it was new. It has never failed me. I've taken care of it, and it has taken care of me. Love the handling, ease of getting into tight spots. Low cost to maintain. Fun to drive.",Commuting to work
2007,Honda,Accord,"I had a very positive experience with this car until about 20,000 mi.At this time the brake pedal began going down and feeling soft and braking became bad.upon taking to dealer they decided it needed new master cylinder,they did not have part,had to revisit to get installed.A few days later same problem began again.Upon third[3]visit i was informed it needed a modulator assy over[ $1000.00]part also not in stock.On fourth{4}visit this part was installed.My brakes are now normal.One of the problems here appears to be they are trying to operate with too few parts in stock.",

2009,Honda,Accord,"This is by far the best car I have ever purchased. It handles like a luxury car and even includes all the safety features that you would find in a Lexus or Benz. The engine has plenty of power even though it is only a 4 cyl. I have wasted my life thinking that I should by American cars and the only thing I have ever gotten from that is grief and poor quality. Honda engineers these cars to near perfection and that is the reason that they are so popular. You will not be dissapointed with this car or any Honda product. My Brother has a Honda Civic with 200,000 miles and no sign of let up. As a previous reviewer stated they would only buy American. I would say to them; in this economy, you get what you pay for and you are going to be paying for nothing but repairs and more for gas. I will buy an American car when they start manufacturing quality cars and good prices. Until that day comes, I will stick to my Honda Accord. Best product on the market in this price range.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,Nothing to complain about. Car could handle 2 large labrador retrievers and groceries. Great fuel economy. Never had any problems with this car over the 4 years we've owned it. Would buy another one for the family in a heartbeat.,Family transportation
2007,Honda,Fit,"Love Hatchbacks first of all. My friends don't like the style, but they obviously don't have any(laughs). It's a small, compact car that can take me anywhere, without blowing all my money on gas. Great for taking my siblings out- there's enough leg room for everyone(though I might add that only one sibling that is 6'3""- he sits in the front for leg room!). Has amazing cargo space for when I take my trips, and of course the back seats fold down just in case I need more space! Great car overall- my baby is going over 200,000 Miles, and she's still been good to me.\nNot a lot of bad things I can say about this car. I have the base model, so I wish they included the AUX port for it, and maybe cruise control(laughs) but okay okay the only issue I've really had with it is that it's hard to work inside the hood(it is compact after all), but then again my hands are a little swollen and big.",Family transportation
2009,Honda,Fit,Overall I would buy another. At 50K I sold it to my step-son-in-law who needed a small daily driver w/ great fuel economy. At that point I had an extra vehicle and parted with it. I do miss it however every time I am at the pump with my Infinity G37S. What used to be $10 fill ups is not $60. Very practical and well engineered with the way the back seats fold two ways. Downside was the acceleration and acceleration at higher speeds to pass...,
2007,Honda,Fit,"Love to drive this car! 5 speed manual transmission is very tight. I'm 6'5'' and I can still fit very comfortably in this Honda Fit. Has 60/40 rear seat, which, with hatchback, gives a wide assortment of cargo carrying options.",Commuting to work

And it gets almost the same fuel mileage as the smaller engine!",Family transportation
2007,Honda,Accord,"This is my third Honda. I was considering waiting for the 08 to come out but got such a good deal on my 07 EXL I decided not to wait. I bought the 4 cylinder model with automatic. Plenty of power and great fuel economy. I have been averaging 24 to 26 MPG in town and 34 to 38 on a trip. I have owned several BMW's in the past.I actually test drove a new 3 series to compare. Yes, this car will not outhandle or outperform the gold standard but for 20,000 less I can live with the few shortcomings. Had I bought the V-6 I think the difference would be even less. I like the Honda navigation system better and it is very nimble and actually handles very Euro. I feel that with better set of tires the difference would be less noticeable. I bought the 100,000 7 year extended warranty so I have no worries about any future repairs. If my past experience with Honda is any indication I will not be needing it anyway. I drove a new Camry but did not like it quite as well and my experience with Toyota is they nickel and dime you to death with scheduled necessary maintenance. There is nothing other than oil changes for the first 100,000 miles for my new Accord. I have a great dealer with a stellar service department should I need their service. If there is a better car out there I have yet to find it for the money. It is all about reliability and tremendous resale value. I drive a 97 Accord EX wagon that I bought 3 years ago with 87,000 miles on it. I have put over 30,000 in those three years with 0 repairs other than maintenance. During the same three years I have rented 30 or so Fords from Hertz and have been stranded three times in the three years on car all with less than 20,000 miles on the odometer. So much for the American reliability but then my sticker says the Accord has 65% US content which is more than some of the US brands out there. I am not dissappointed in my purchase.",

2007,Honda,CR-V,"We love this car for it's handling, style, and most importanly how to save on gas. Some say it is a little slow to move because it is a 4 cylinder but I still find it is nimbly enough to maneuver on the interstate. I love how to the doors open the full 90 degrees to get kids and carseats in and out of the back seat. We also have a large breed dog and the back hatch is not as angled as it is on some of those other small SUVs so he has more room than most.

2008,Honda,Odyssey,"We love the flexibility of this vehicle, as it adapts to passengers and cargo on a minute's notice. You'd be surprised what you can fit in the Honda, once you lower or move seats around. The road noise on this vehicle is pretty substantial so if you're looking for something quiet then this is not for you. But if you need to get kids safely to school, allow for an extra passenger (or 3) from time to time, transport kids and their gear to all sorts of sports activities and occasionally make a longer trip, then this vehicle fits the bill.","Didn't ""want"" a minivan but the benefits of the Odyssey outweighed my initial concerns. Something that we hadn't originally considered was the ability for our kids to get in/out of the vehicle on their own, without stepping down (from a higher SUV).  Also, the sliding rear doors meant no more dings into the neighboring car.  The seats fold in several directions allowing a great deal of flexibility for either more passengers or more gear."

 I suspect these negative comments comes from Honda'a
 competitors desperate to bear false witness to Honda

My daughter has my 1995 Honda it still is driving okay even though I neglected the maintenance at times. My Honda 2007 has excellent gas mileage, drives good and rides quietly. I would highly recommend a o Honda Accord to my friends.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"The CR-V is a fantastic city / urban automobile. Great handling, very easy to drive and park on city streets, small enough to get good gas mileage yet big enough to drive to home depot and fill it up with everything you may need.",Family transportation
2009,Honda,Element,Very versitle and can do everything that I need with it. Lots of room on the inside and easy to clean because there are no carpets. Perfect for those who have pets. Rear seats can be removed and you can put just about anything in the back! It does have some road noise and the MPG is not great but overall the best vehicle I have owned.,Commuting to work
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"Spacious, great on hauling kids & equipment around town & awesome on long road trips! Handles really nice, comfortable and room for 8! Love the DVD, Navigation and stereo. Excellent air conditioning throughout vehicle; lots of storage in rear if seats are up or down!",Spacious for passengers and personal objects!  Comfortable ride around town or on long road trips!
2009,Honda,Civic,"this is a great fun sporty car, enough room to get the kid in the back seat and have fun cruising throughout the mountains. Doubles as a great grocery getter and the color gets everyones attention. Comfy ride, sound system is awesome! When you're in traffic and you need to get around that slow poke in front of you... just ask vtec, she'll get the job done every time! \nQuick to accelerate, great in corners, you ask this car to do something and it get it done every time. Easy maintenance for the DIY guys!",Commuting to work
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"As vans go, this one is great. \nIt seems to have the interior space of a big gas-guzzler like a Sequoia or Suburban, but with good fuel economy. Three of the six cylinders are deactivated when you are cruising at steady speed. Even at 80 mph, the ""Eco"" light comes on, telling you that you are doing it with three cylinders.\nIt can jump out into the left lane and accelerate up a mountain pass when you need it to. No problems maintaining speed even at 9,000 ft altitude.\nGreat for camping and ski trips. Great in snow if you put some snow tires on it. \nThe twin power sliding doors were a novelty a few years ago, but they seem essential now. I put some WeatherTec mats in it, so I'm not worried about the carpet when hauling sloppy ski gear, plants from the nursery, or bikes. \nThis is just a really solid car, no reliability issues and very few annoying ticks.\nI'm over 80,000 miles with little more than the usual preventative maintenance items, oil changes, brakes and tires. The struts were replaced around 75,000 miles and the power steering pump was serviced or replaced for free on a recall. \nOK, I'm itching to buy a really cool looking convertible, but this thing is just far too practical to give up in exchange for a little ego boost.",Incredibly practical and reliable.; Versatile seat configurations for hauling passengers or for hauling large items.; The leather interior is pretty luxurious. You forget you are in a minivan.; Sound system rocks.
2009,Honda,Accord,"We have the 4-cylinder EX-L sedan and I have to agree with others that report lower quality and gas mileage than Honda declares. I drive the car to work about 70 miles round trip each day. Plus a little stop at the store a few times a week. I write down my miles and gas used each tip in a trip log. So far we average only 26.4 mpg. Also, when we were off for a week a few times on vacation or Holiday, we averaged only about 19 mpg. My wife is no hot rodder and neither am I.
  Issues: Seats on not really comfortable for long. After an hour, you will think about a Chiropractor. The ride is far from smooth and my wife finds that she is concerned at times about steering control. Handling is mediocre ride is bumpy with pavement cracks felt. Don't be fooled by how it feels for a 20 minutes test drive. Also, we have some wind noise leakage at a rear window, and the dealer says its only during high winds??
  Our family has owned Toyota, Nissan, Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, a Saturn, and a previous Honda. We don;t see the quality or fuel savings others are claiming. This is no better and, in some ways, worse than other cars we have had. We also test drove a Camry, Mazda 6, Ford Fusion, Saturn Aura, and Chevrolet Malibu. We 
 liked the Malibu and Saturn Aura and now wonder if we should have gotten oen of those.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"The honda civic is a great commuter car. I currently have 94K on the odometer, treat the car like crap, and have no issues. Just oil, gas and go. At 30+MPG how can you go wrong with the civic ?",Commuting to work

2009,Honda,Accord,"Our 2009 Honda Accord EX sedan has been a great car since we purchased it used with 35,000 miles. The only thing we've done other than oil changes is we had to have the rear brakes replaced at 50,000 miles. That was somewhat disappointing since the calipers were shot as well, so it was an expensive fix. I could understand the pads needing replacing, but the calipers were a disappointment. Other than that, the car has been fantastic. It's very good in snow with the traction control and the 5 speed manual transmission. I recommend snow tires for it if you drive in winter conditions, however. It's a fun car to drive, with sports car-like handling and decent acceleration--especially for a 4 cylinder. The a/c sucks up some of the power, though and hurts your gas mileage. We've got 34 mpg on a trip before so mileage is very good. I know the motor will go well over 200,000 miles so if we can keep the body from rusting out, we plan on driving it for years to come. We'll be back for another Accord when it's time to trade.",It's a Honda---reliability and build-quality factor is superb.   Audio system sounds very good.  Love the 5-speed transmission--a rarity in cars anymore!     Very roomy inside--the back seat is huge.   Very good power for a 4 cylinder---as long as you leave the air conditioning off.
2008,Honda,Accord,"new Accord style, space inside, fuel economy, great during the winter with winter tires,\ngood handling, cargo is small,back seats should be 40/60, after 105000 mil still having original breaks, this is my 3 Honda accord , good experience ,",Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,"The most uncomfortable seats I have ever encountered.They feel like cloth wrapped around cement.I also own a 2003 Accord with much more comfortable seats. So I was not thinking too much about seat comfort on my test drive, a big mistake.
 I trying my third seat cushion in less than 2 weeks so I can at least tolerate driving this car. Check Edmunds .com reviews about the uncomfortable seats. 
 Also the mpg is less than 2003 Accord.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Uncomfortable seating, hard riding, mpg far less than expected. 17- 26 calculated each tank. Noisy wind leak from window.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"We have about 6,500 miles so far on the Accord. Mostly town road and freeway to work and school. It isn't getting the mileage we ***************** and my wife is not a hot rodder. We got 27.4 calculated on a 324 mile round trip to visit my wifes parents. Around town we get 17 - 19 mpg. We did better in a 5 year old Malibu Maxx V6 with 66,000 miles on it. 19- 22 city and 30 - 34 hiway both calculated. Also, interior isn't as good as former Hondas we don't think. We had an 2000 Accord. Fit and finish is average inside and out, with an annoying rattle from somewhere. The dealer service department has been pushy and left dirt foot prints on the floor mats.
  We had driven a Saturn Aura and really liked it. Also drove a Camry and Nissan Altima. The Altima was nice but didn't feel comfortable or safe in it. 
  If we could have found a Saturn XR 4cyl with the exterior and interior color my wife liked, we would have ************** regrets buying this Honda now and says she would have gone with her second color choce(red) in the Saturn if she could. The Saturn had a 30 day return if not satisfied. We listened to too many people and car magazines touting foreign cars. Hype. A friend at work has an '08 Saturn Aura and loves it.",
2007,Honda,Accord,"This is my second accord, previously owned a 2003. Car is reliable but they did not take the time to make any changes at all. I pay for a new car and expect something at least to be different. The interior is exactly like my old one. The car rides nice and smooth.",
2007,Honda,Accord,"The thing I am completely disappointed in is the gas mileage. I have under 7500 miles bought it on Dec. 30, 2006. On the highway I get 30 to 31 miles to a gallon at best. Local is awful just 20 miles to a gallon. This was my main reason for trading my old car. It was in excellent shape with only 32,000 miles. I got 20 miles to a gallon local on that and traded in hoping to get better mileage as hey tell you which is not true. If u are not doing mostly highway driving forget about gas mileage your not going to get it and with the price of gas going higher all the time, think it over.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"Very dissapointed. Rattles inside, wind noise and developed water leaks around windows. Drives like a truck, suspension is stiff and seats are very uncomfortable.

2008,Honda,Odyssey,"For the most part, our Odyssey has been trouble free or the problems that have occurred were covered under the warranty or the dealer chose to cover the items. We've paid about $800 out of pocket servicing the van since we purchased it. We've had a recurring issue with the power steering (makes an odd noise and sometimes goes out - dealer has done the resevoir but not the pump, extended warranty provided by Honda on the pump), brakes make noise at low speeds (been refinished, adjusted and re-set multiple times but problem comes back) and we recently had to replace both front axle assemblies. The last one really concerns me. I've owned multiple vehicles through the years and some with as many as over 150,000 miles on them. I've never ever had to replace a front end axle assembly in my life and I own a 25 year old Porsche that's been raced! While the van looks and feels like a Honda, it is clearly not engineered like the other Hondas. I really do not expect to keep this van past 5 years or 60,000 miles for fear of major mechanical problems involving the transmission or drivetrain down the road. I've owned Hondas all my life. The Accord is a tough car to beat, extremely reliable and easy to maintain. This minivan takes a beating with three small kids. We are completely dependent on it at times. However, the issues above are safety issues and I am constantly concerned that something will go wrong while my wife is driving it. We may have a bad one and others may be better but Consumer Reports rates the reliability worse than average and I think that is quite accurate. If you buy one, try one that is not the first model year of a complete redesign. Try a 2009 or 2010 if you can afford it. I am sure some of these bugs are worked out in those vehicles.","Large, features, safety, design, layout of instruments and buttons, fit and quality"

Fuel mileage is okay. We average about 22mpg with our other Element. Power is average. Youre not going to pass a lot of people at the stoplight. The TPMS light is a pain in the rear end if you use your own set of winter wheels and tires. UPDATE. The rear calipers were sticking and basically wore out the pads.

I drove 1,700 miles from New Mexico to Florida at about 27mpg. On the 1,700 mile return, drove well into the night, stopped at a rest stop reclined the seats all the way back and slept like a baby..best seats ever. I hate to say it but I love the Odyssey. \nExtremely Roomy, DVD and Navigation system are an added bonus. Wireless headsets for the kids to watch movies while you listen to XM radio is #1.

My husband was impressed with the 4 door graphite, moon & sunroof, leather package w/dual controls. Lets just say fully loaded with only 5 - 10 miles on it.

Stadium seating allows for good visibility for rear seated passengers which is important for those folks suffering from car sickness. \nThe rear seats are simple to remove & install which allows for a smooth deck when loading cargo.\nNo repairs have been required and scheduled maintenance is minimal. Since this is my 2nd Element I would not hesitate recommending it to a friend or relative.,"Utility (towing boats, transporting cargo, etc.)"
2008,Honda,Fit,I absolutely love my Honda Fit. I can fit a lot of musical equipment in it for my job and can also move larger items on the weekends and when I go shopping. It is a lot of fun to drive and parking is a breeze.,Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,We've owned this car for 9 months and it's been one headache after another. The drivers window fell off the track the second day we had it. The transmission died after 3 weeks(1500 miles). The water pump started leaking at 6000 miles. There are numerous rattles and squeaks that the dealer cannot locate. The dealer has told us that the squeaks and rattles are normal! Honda's quality(or lack thereof) is woefully lacking. My advice is to buy something else.,
2008,Honda,Element,"The whole concept of ruff and ready rubber mats seats moving up and out of the way all lends it's self to an owner who is very active, physical, camping, canoeing, biking, and a dog owner.

Although the car was totaled, my son was able to walk away from that accident with only minor bruises. The car he was driving was my first Honda and I made sure to replace that car with a 2007 Honda Accord. When the time comes, I will only consider a Honda. On a lighter note, the car is great looking, very roomy and has great pick-up. I would recommend a Honda Accord to anyone looking for a car.",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,Performance: It rides like a rolling movie theater! Smooth & Comfortable.\nBuild quality: Second to none!\nAppearance: Is really nice and aerodynamic. Saves on gas with a system \nthat shuts down to four cylinder on the highway. It is fun to drive as well. \nPretty peppy compared to other vehicles in its class. \nThe cost to own is very very very fair and reasonable. Its trouble free.,You CANNOT beat the comfort and convenience.
2009,Honda,Accord,"I have to add my voice to those who are dissatisfied with the accord. I bought an Accord 2009 EX-L with Nav.(The Works)I have always had a Toyota and American Made Cars. the problems I 've encountered with the Accord are not in any other car. American Honda just settled a class action law suit due to rear brake inferior pads. The claim that Honda will take care of you is a big lie. Do not trust them and take an advice from an owner of a brand new accord(2009) stay away. Save your money and buy a quality car. The brake noise is a characteristic of Honda and outside noise is unbelievable. The rattle noise in the back which I also experienced is due to missing screws according to the dealership. I am hiring a lawyer to use the lemon law and see if I can get my money back. I am also dealing with the BBB Autoline as well as the department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs in VA.
 I rate this car two stars..one for the color and the other for the amenities.
 Good luck to all owners of the Accord.",
2009,Honda,Accord,"this car is good , the quality inside and out is nice better than its competitor , it has a good gas mileage , very stable in the highway i feel confident inside it , the bad thing about it that i hear a wind whistling during my highway drive , and the seat is little bit uncomfortable. and beside its little expensive than the other competitor , other than ******** a great car .",

2009,Honda,Fit,"Our 2009 Honda Fit has been a fun reliable companion since we bought it new. Our Fit has been a commuter car, pet transporter, cargo hauler, RV TOAD, and weekend getaway enabler.\nHonda did a wonderful job designing the ""magic"" rear seats. With the seats in their upright position you can ""fit"" two actual adults in the back of the car without the front seat passengers having to eat the super long dash. With the rear seats fully collapsed into the floor, the ""fit"" transforms into a wonderfully roomy cargo/pet hauler with a flat floor.\nSure our little four cylinder automatic Fit could use a bit more power and it does get a bit buzzy on the highway, but it's hard to beat our experience of 36mpg average with a mix of city and highway driving. Handling is decent, although feedback is a bit numb, and braking is respectable, if a bit spongy at times.\nOne feature in the automatic sport is the ability to ""sport shift"" the automatic using F1 style steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. This feature can be slightly amusing but at the end of the day is a bit of a waste of time since the shifting isn't especially crisp when using the paddle shifters and the little four banger, while providing admirable fuel economy, is a bit buzzy and under-powered.\nAt the end of the day we love our little Honda Fit. For us it simply ""Fit""s our lifestyle and needs.",Commuting to work
2009,Honda,Accord,"Well, with respect to the guy with the military background, the car is ""okay."" There are many American cars built as well though. I can honestly say I wouldn't classify it as a ""great"" car. It absolutely doesn't get more than 22 miles to the gallon wasn't expecting more. It's my daughter's car bought by her grandpa for 16yh birthday. It has poor visibility in the back due to the pillars being slanted and wide. It's leather seats are hard and uncomfortable. It's hard to get into, I'm 5'8"" tall and 210lbs. I feel like I have to crawl. The ride too is quite rough. She's already been hit at a stop sign, not her fault and the sheetmetal is paper thin. I kept the fender for a souvenir. The fit and finish seem good and the car handles well. I drive a 97 Dodge Ram and so feel like I'm in a cracker box with the Accord. It's been a long time since I've been afraid of getting hit in a car. I do it in the Accord. Even with a 5 star safety rating. I pity anyone in an Accord that's in an accident with a full size truck. That's probably the same for any small car like this. I would never buy the car for myself or any other small car. The car gets a great deal of looks and comments from the younger crowd. They love it.",

2008,Honda,Accord,"This is my fifth Honda Accord and 7th Honda that I've owned. I love Accord improvements. In my opinion, the 2.4 liter engine has plenty of power. I test drove and considered the V6 model. It had plenty of power as well but I just didn't see the need to spend the extra money for the V6. I have just gone over 35,000 miles. At 30,000 miles, my Honda dealer replaced the brakes for free as a warranty item. Outside of this, I haven't had any problems with the car. The gas mileage has been good. In combined city/highway commuter driving, I average 26 miles per gallon. On long trips, we average about 31 miles per gallon. Overall, it's been a great car. The car is two years old and people still stop me in the parking lot to ask me how I like the car. Honda's styling appears to catch many people's eyes.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"Car is a pleasure to drive but keep having little problems not to mention needing new brakes and tires well before 30k miles. My local dealer's (Piedmont Honda in Anderson,SC) service department is no help at all. I recently sent in a Service Satisfaction Survey and filled it out to the best of my ability being 100% honest. Shortly thereafter, the Service Manager called and informed me that the General Manager said that I could not come back to their Dealership - go figure! Truth hurts and then they shoot the messenger. Wonder why the GM couldn't call me himself. I had asked for him at an earlier visit and some other person claimed to be the GM. Overall, a decent car and a horrible dealer!",
2008,Honda,Accord,"What a piece of Junk.Problem's after problems. Had to Replace brakes at 15,000 miles and tires at 21,000 miles. Needed wheel alingments and suspension parts already. The dealer gives me the run around and can't seem to figure out the problems. It has a bad suspension design by Honda causing premature brakes and tires to wear out per the service manager. I'mgoing back to Ford's.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I cannot recommend the 2008 Honda Accord with v6. There are vibration issues with the suspension, in addition to the vibration and sound of the VCM and transmission constantly searching for the correct number of cylinders and gear. This is our 5th and last Accord. Unlike any car we've had in the last 20 years, the engine on this car burns oil.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"Have a 2008 EX-L (2.5 4Cyl) purchased new in June 2008. Have put on over 30,000 miles with none of the issues noted in other reviews. Get excellent gas mileage of 25-26 in town and 30-32 on highway. Frequently drive 550 miles or more on a tank. Absolutely no issues with excessive tire or break wear.
 
 Interior fit and finish is excellent and ride is solid and comfortable. Very happy with the performance. Car gets up to freeway speeds with no problems and maintains 70 mph at about 2500 rpm.
 
 Trunk is cavernous and the interior is more than big enough for 4 adults on an extended trip. Entertainment system is excellent as is the overall instrumentation and seating. 
 
 I highly recommend this vehicle. Now I just hope it goes 200,000 plus like my 2003 Accord.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"All the articles about Honda and what these articles claim need to be addressed. This car is one problem after another.

It was a bad suspension design by Honda causing premature brakes and tires to wear out.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"Overall, we're quite satisfied with this car with 18000 miles driven, mostly pleasure travel, in the past 8 months. Negatives include front seat comfort, particularly the passengers seat, and overall fuel usage with 22.5 mpg for primarily highway travel.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"We've owned an EX-L for year and have driven it 5,000 miles so far. On the positive side: it is comfortable, has great views of the front, sides and rear and has not missed a beat. On the negative side: the city fuel economy is 10-15% less than the stated 21 MPG, a rattle developed in the glove box area (but was fixed by Honda) and the seats have difficult ingress/egress due to the side bolsters. A great car, but it comes with a few bugs.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"This car has a very stiff suspension and does not offer the smooth and quiet ride as some comparible sedans in its class. It might not be suitable for someone who drives long distances often because the rough ride feels like the tires are over inflated and the wind and road noise can get overbearing after an hour of driving. The engin also whines at low speeds which can get annoying. Overall, I'm a bit dissatisfied with this car.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I purchased the last 2008 on the lot on 12/31/08. I think I got a pretty good deal as the dealer was ready to let this baby go. It's a 6-Speed Loaded Coupe. It's very fast and I get pretty good gas mileage....about 22 mpg average. This is the 6th Honda I've owned and I have to say I like everything about it except that Honda has cut corners to save money. The carpeting is nowhere near as thick and as good quality as the Accord Coupe I traded in. The factory carpet floor mats are about 1/2 the weight of the ones in my old Accord. I hope they last as well as the old ones did. The dash and other interior finish just seems cheaper than my former Accord. All-in-all, I love the car...tremendous power and responsive handling. The heated seats are great and the XM radio is nice, although I resent a pay service having commercials like regular radio.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"When my 1999 Toyota Avalon died with 173,000 miles, I looked for a new one but did not like some design features. Went for the Honda Accord 6 cyl. but am not very happy. 
 
 Gas mileage is approximately 16-17 mpg city and 18-20 highway. I was doing much better with my old 6 cyl. Avalon. I drive efficiently but the results do not show.
 
 Ride is ok but find panel with all the controls a bit difficult to use when in motion--very distracting. Sound quality of the top line stereo is adequate but disappointing. 
 
 I have owned it since August and will stick with it but expected more from this top rated vehicle. Next time I will look elsewhere.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I have had this Accord EXL for a little over a year, it has been an excellent car in ride and handling. The gas mileage runs between 29mpg in town to 33mpg hwy.

Also have a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado (160,000 miles) when has be a great truck.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I purchased a 2008 Honda Accord 4 door sedan EXL automatic in February 2008, and after owning three previous EXL ACCORD SEDANS I am very disappointed with this latest edition. The increased horsepower gets the car going entering the highway but the gAS ECONOMY SUFFERS NOT REALIZING THE TOUTED EXAMPLES IN THE SALES MATERIAL especially in the winter driving months when additives to the gasoline to prevent freezing drops the mileage. BUT the most annoying thing is the moaning and groaning from the ? engine - transmission- and/or the power steering unit when the car is going less than 25 miles per hour. It sounds like an old car and I am not at all satisfied. I have taken the car back to the dealership 4 times, the last time was for the Honda representative to drive it and asess the noises. Notations have been made on the permanet record for this vehicle but so far there is no resolve. I am tempted to get out of it by trading it in. But because of our US economy, I would have to spend over 6K dollars to move into the 09 Accord exl and then I do not know if I would like the 6 - 4- 3 cylinder operation offered on that car. Some people love it and others have written negatively about it and I am not sure that the gas mileage would be as stated. On recent test drives the V6 automatic was exceptionally quiet to drive unlike my pepped up 4 cylinder. On the 4 cyl. the road noise is something awful too. The michelin tires last like iron..but they ride like it too and make a lot of noise. For all the descriptions for the stereo radio system, the sound is cheap and unpleasant no matter which adjustments you make. Don't
  get me wrong the last 3 Accords were excellent and never let me down and they held their value at trade in time. I am just in a pickle with this current situation. My next step just might be contacting HONDA CARS of AMERICA directly.",

Would like to contact Honda technical support to determine if I have something wrong with suspension but do not have their number;",
2008,Honda,Accord,"Traded in my 99 Mustang GT convertible for the Accord when my job changed and I needed to drive 40 miles daily on the interstate. . .the EX-L coupe is sporty looking and handles well. . .my gas mileage is around 27-28 in mostly highway driving (vs. 20 for the Mustang) and it's quiet and comfortable on the road. The V-4 has more than enough power for reasonable driving acceleration. Love the XM radio built-in also! Don't bother with the 2 grand extra for the navigator- you can get GPS's now for 100 bucks if you need that.
  Minor beefs- the passenger door locks automatically when you park the car- why? How many people are going to be driving the coupe with a small kid in the passenger front seat?? Also, the remote control lock sets off a loud honk from the horn-annoying. 
  These gripes aside, I'm very satisfied and would buy an Accord again.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I love my Honda! It drives excellent, mileage has been 29 MPG highway and 22 city! The power seat is great and the stereo is amazing. This is my second Honda and I love driving this car. I bought this car brand new and it's the second car I bought brand new, well worth it!",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I have owned 6 Honda Accords and I loved every ride
 from my '84 to my 9 mo. old '08. My wife and children
 have been the proud owners of 16 Civics and Accords.
 Domestics cars are no match for the the perfect 
 combination of reliability, resale value, styling, performance, and affordability found in the Honda.
 Yes, I've owned Chevys, Plymouths, Buicks, Fords in
 my foolish younger days but I have seen the light. 
 I just sold my '96 Accord with 250,000 miles on it.
 The engine, transmission and body are in good shape.
 Of the domestics, only my '78 Buick Century Wagon
 got to 120,000 miles before the head gasket cracked
 and I sold it. 
 I doubt whether the Rednecks that talk trash 
 about the Honda ever owned one. What's not to like
 about the Accord? Just ask the Research Test Drivers at Consumers Report,Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and Road and Track magazines.
 Its hard to deny the evidence from car sales
 and expert reviews over many years that Honda
 is a great way to spend your transportation dollar. I paid less that $20,000 for my '08 Accord with 
 the styling,quality, reliability, and size that
 rivals the BMW's 535i series.
  My '08 Accord is 60%
  US/Canada made( assembled in Maryville,OH) compared to Ford Fusion's 40%(assembled in Mexico).

I am leasing a 2008 Coupe, 4 cylinder with really nice cloth interior. It is silver, loooks great in the lot but what really impresses me is when I take it out on the road. the handling is very, very good, the breaks (which many people complained about) do a very good job. I average around 24 mpg combined and around 30-31 mpg highway. Plan to purchase when lease is over.",

2008,Honda,Accord,"We chose the Accord, 6 cylinder. Very nice sound system, handling, etc. BUT! After driving on the highway, the road noise was deafening! We actually turned it back within 2 weeks after discussing our displeasure with the dealer. We now have a Toyota Camry. Even though we lost money on this whole deal, it was better than listening to that noise for the 3 year lease.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I purchased my 08 Accord in May. Great gas mileage.
 I came out of a 2002 Avalon and there is a bit of difference in the ride. The Avalon at 6 years old was still smoother and handled like a luxury vehicle. The Accord has a lot more road noise. The interior is very roomy and I love the body style. However, I realize I purchased a cheaper vehicle this time so I have to manage my expectations. The sheet metal is very thin and the plastic bumper gives with the press of your thumb. Not sure If I will purchase another. Will likely go back to a Toyota which I drove for 21 years. I have leather seats and every 2-3 weeks I have to clean them because the color from my clothing rubs off and it shows and makes the seat look dirty. I only had to clean my seats in the Avalon every 3-6 months.",

2008,Honda,Accord,"I bought a brand new 20o8 Honda Accord EX in April.
 I am very pleased with this vehicle especially the great gas mileage. (I chose not to spend the extra money for the 6 cylinder) I didn't feel like the additinal price was worth it for what you were getting. What really suprised me is that this top-of-\the-line vehicle doesn't come with a built-in Homelink garage door opener. I was kind of shocked after delivery to find this out. Peculiar as my previous vehicles a 1997 Chrysler Sebring and a 2002 Chrysler 300M had a built in system. In order to get the opener you would have to shell out the extra money for the EX V6....Kind of a turn-off.",

2008,Honda,Accord,"My husband purchased my Honda for our 22nd Anniversay
 in June, and I appreciate this car. It was such a pretty car on the lot, and when I got it home it became beautiful. The gas mileage is great, it is a large car compared to what I was driving, but I've managed to get comfortable with it and how it handles. We got the EX-L and even though some reviews say the ""L"" stands for leather, to us it stands for luxury. The car has more than leather seats, it also has a wonderful navigational system that I personally enjoy using. I enjoy the 6-discs CD changer and the XM radio and the speakers are perfectly clear.
 I'm not going to say anything negative about my car because there is no such thing as a perfect car. If anyone is looking for a nice car that handles well looks wonderful and a nice miser with gas then the HONDA ACCORD is the car to buy.
 I call my car the Honey Wagon because my Honey bought it for me.",
2008,Honda,Accord,I traded my 2004 Honda Accord to the new sleek looking 2008 4 door. I downgraded from the V6 to 4 and what great gas mileage getting already. City driving the first couple weeks at almost 25 and upto 27 mpg. The 4 cyclinder is as good as my 2004 V6 pickup. The interior is so roomy and comfortable. Got the top of the line with leather seats in the Green metallic. The driver's lumbar support is the best and most comfortable for long distance driving. The back seat folds completely down for additional room when transporting large boxes. I have nothing negative say about this new redesigned style. It is absolutely beautiful and very economic for a midsize coupe. Get compliments all the time. This Honda is a keeper.,
2008,Honda,Accord,"I have been driving an almost-new (about 8k miles) Hertz rental, while my car is in the body shop. Have driven about 1500 miles so far, and am not particularly impressed.
 
 Likes: Styling is unique, instrument cluster, low wind noise, nice loud horn, decent audio
 
 Dislikes: 4-cylinder engine is very sluggish and sounds like it's from a tractor, trans hunts for the right gear when on moderate uphills - slow to upshift, road noise is horrendous - tires thump loudly over bumps and rough pavement sounds like it's a dirt road, seats are uncomfortable, adjustments are coarse, steering is vague on center and very abrupt off center, i/p center stack is very busy

Then I looked at BMW 5, and sure it was nice but at over 50,000 green back I was at the bad end the EURO exchange. Then I 
 drove a loaded 08 Accord with real leather seating, an intelligent 268 horse V6 that squeezes 30 miles out of ONE GALLON OF REGULAR GAS, AND PERFORMANCE THAT IN MY OPINION IS ALLMOST AS GOOD AS THE BMW AND THE MERCEDES BUT WITH BETTER FUEL ECONOMY. 
 
 DOES THE STORY END and AND WHAT IS THE MORAL OF THE STORY. YOU CAN BUY TWO LOADED 08 HONDA ACCORDS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE MERCEDES OR ONE BMW. OR, FOR THE COST OF A 48 MONTH LEASE FOR A BMW OR A MERCEDES YOU
 OWN YOUR 08 ACCORD AND TRADE IT IN WITH THE HIGHEST RESALE VALUE IN ITS CLASS AND PAY LESS THAN
 HALF THE VALUE OF A NEW 2011. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE INTELLIGENT TO OWN AN ACCORD ONLY SMART. ONLY DUMMIES LEASE OR SHOULD I SAY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. NOW I KNOW WHY 80 PERCENT OF ALL BMWS AND MERCEDES ARE LEASED, LOTS OF INTELLIGENT LEASERS OR SHOULD I SAY LOSERS.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"very nice car for the money.25mpg around town.cannot beat it.......oh,for the knucklehead that stated it was like driving around in a pepsi can on wheels,I have seen many ********** by suv's and everybody comes out alive.I can only say that about a honda.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"In February I bought my Accord. This is my first new car that I have ever bought and I have not been disappointed. It has plenty of room in the back seat. All my friends and family loves to ride in it. I gets great gas millage in the city and on the interstate. I love how quiet it is, how it handles, and how it looks. This is a awesome care all around.",
2008,Honda,Accord,A honda accord is nice on the inside but the outside looks like ugly my son who is 19 has the civic si likes it better than the accord and when we go out to dinner he never wants to ride in it because he thinks it looks like a BMW if anyone is thinking of getting a accord look ane the civics if my son would have picked a honad he would pick the civic si the fit sport and the element he loves the the honda but not the the new accord,
2008,Honda,Accord,"I Just recently purchased the Accord 08 2.4 EX coupe. It is polished metal metallic. I just love it! The handling is amazing, very quiet ride. It is comfy and very roomy inside.

2008,Honda,Accord,"This car jumps when you say jump. No matter if it is from a standing start or cruising down the highway and you want to jump past another vehicle, it feels like you're riding a rocket when you push the petal to the floor. The great part is that it also gets great mileage as well, even at 75 MPH. The first day I bought the car I had people staring and saying how beautiful it is. And everytime I drive it I see at least one person point at it (whether they are in their own car or standing on the street). I get more ""Hey, check that out"" stares than any car I've ever driven. Having the EX-L Coupe gives it a luxury feel without the BMW price. The sound system is also just awesome and I've become hooked on XM Radio (no commercials and all the presets I can handle).",

2008,Honda,Accord,"This is absolutely the best car I have owned in years. Car has ample power, styling is tremendous and body fit is masterful. This is my first Accord and I am impressed by the quality. Interior room is very comfortable fo all passengers. All of the options and accessories are made for the enjoyment of those using the car. Once again, Honda has a great car here and I would reccomend it wholeheartedly. It is also the first car in years that I have had people go out of their way to compliment.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"08 Accord LX-P rides very nice stable on corners at high speed, Interior room almost one of the largest, check other cars you won't find many larger in it's class. With 2.4L a little under power but I always want extra for safety but is adequite. Great looks but that's to everyones own taste. Quiet for the price range this car is in, and quality very high detail as always with the Honda products.Trunk space is 14cu., there are a few cars larger but only up to 15.5cu. Milage has yet to be proven, first tank 17.2MPG.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I just bought a honda accord because of the price but am really not happy at all. I feel like I am riding in a pepsi can with wheels. No wonder it gets great gas mileage because there is no sheet metal surrounding me . I guess I learned the hard way , you get what you pay for . Safety is more important to me then gas mileage . How many miles to empty when an SUV hits you who cares . I should have stuck with a Ford or Chevy you really do get what you pay for I am going to learn the quick when I lose 10000 dollars trading in the bucket o bolts",

2008,Honda,Accord,"I have always owned Hondas and have passed the tradition down to my children as well. I traded in my 07 exl-V6 for the 08 EXL-V6. The upgrade in quality and performance was amazing. I ended up rolling alot of money over to get into it but thought it was worth it because this car is a definate keeper. The power and performance is amazing. I have owned Acura and Nissan Maxima and have always thought the quality of the Honda far exceeded the quality of the Maxima, now Honda Accord will outgun the Maxima as well. This is basically an Acura[Honda made as well], this car compares very favorably to the TL and is much better in most areas. It's a nice feeling knowing I own one of the most well built, longest lasting cars on the road. I love Hondas impeccable reputation and legendary reputation for quality. It's comforting to know when you buy one that it will ast you years. check out this website,,,,Honda.highmilers.com It pretty much says it all.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"We recently purchased a new Honda Accord '08, and I have to say it is better than any Honda my spouse and I have ever owned. I love the room this car has. I think it is the largest sedan to date, and it is still a very sporty car. I feel very safe driving the family around, which was not always the case with our past Honda's, where they really did have a ""compact"" car feeling. For a car that can be purchased in the low 20's I feel like I am driving a luxury car! The dealership told us, also, that this car cannot be hotwired, so this should no longer be near the top of the most stolen cars list. Check it out people, it is a great car!",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I am a first time Honda owner. Two weeks ago I purchased the 2008 Honda Accord LXP. What a fun car to drive. Quiet ride, lots of room and handles great on the road. I looks like a luxury car and on the road it is hard to distinguish the Accord from the Acura. My husband is over six feet and has lots of room. The quiet ride is a blessing.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I have to say Honda has surely done right by this car. I have never like Honda, the style was all wrong, it looked too much like a family car. I liked the sporty look )BMW, Acura, Lexus)that all changed when I saw the 2008 Accord. My wife wanted efficiency and she got it! We picked up the EX-L V6 w/ Nav, stock on this model is fully loaded. I drove a BMW 540it sport wagon, although the Honda does not have a V8 I was surprised at the pick-up and the handling. The interior is roomy, especially with the doors opening a great deal more than normal, easy to get the kids in and out and very accommodating for trunk space. The instrument cluster and the gauges are very, very user friendly, Navigation is great! a must have. We haven't even opened the manual yet and we have been able to figure everything out.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"The only downfall I see is the when backing up it is difficult to see out the rear window, (especially with a rear spoiler) but Honda has a back up camera which is an option, another must have.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"All in all, very happy in Oakland,CA.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"Just picked my new 08 Accord LXP sedan 2 weeks ago. This car is an upgrade to my 06 Accord LX sedan and has a lot of features my other one didn't such as 16 in alloys, steering wheel mounted audio controls, ipod aux port, 4 wheels disc brakes, vehicle stability assist with trac control. It has adequate power for a 4 cyl 177, up 11 from my 06. The ride is still that stiff, sporty Honda suspension but it has been refined quite a bit, smoother for sure. It is definately no longer a mid sized sedan. It drives like a larger, heavier car. The headroom legroom and shoulder room have increased quite a bit and is immediately noticed by the driver. The car has completely changed from the 06 and 07 models, the ONLY unchanged aesthetic is the remote/key combo. I'm quite impressed so far with the 358 miles I've racked up in 2 weeks.",
2008,Honda,Accord,"I just recently bought the all-new 2008 Accord and absolutely love it! I had a 2004 accord and changed over to a truck. Upon seeing the new Accord, I had to have it! The handling, pick-up, and interior is awesome! This is one great car!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"bought it new, it's ok but really no better than any other car in its segment, and people have left notes on my windshield saying I have an ugly car, I tend to agree",
2007,Honda,Civic,Great car,
2007,Honda,Civic,I never thought I'd buy a Honda but I did-in 2007 I bought the Civic SI. I couldn't be more happy with it. One day I was stopped at a ************ behind an old station wagon-while waiting for the lite to change I ******* from the rear by an old Oldsmobile. I pictured my trunk inside my rear seat! Well NOTHING! The damn car held up beautifully. I was amazed how sturdy this small car was. I want to give this car to my nephew when he's ready for it because I do know how safe it is. GO HONDA! My only complaint-I wanted leather heated seats!,
2007,Honda,Civic,i will never own a honda again i had a 2006 honda accord brand new to this thing had so many problems after 50000 miles i got it rid of it i'm driving now a 1970 ford LTD it has 200000 miles and it runs better than any car i have ever drivin you got to love america,
2007,Honda,Civic,"After 10 years of VWs, I'm back to Honda for the
 reliability and gas mileage on regular gas.
 VWs would be great cars if it weren't for the
 reliability problems and the majority of their
 cars take premium gas. I told the salesman at
 Honda, it would be great if they could put the
 desirable VW interiors in the Honda! I did love
 driving the VW when it wasn't in the shop and
 will miss it.
 
 All my previous (three)Hondas never had a 
 problem and only went in for regular maintenance. This Honda Civic EX is no exception, I have had
 no mechanical or electrical problems and the 
 sunroof doesn't rattle like two my VWs! I get 
 between 28 and 36 mpg on regular gas, depending
 on how I shift the transmission. I was surprised to find out the oil wt. recommended is 5w-20w. 
 This may be why some people are getting worse 
 gas mileage, if they are putting in 5w-30w (like
 I almost did)or 5w-40w. 
 
 The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the tires
 sold on this car SUCK. It comes with either
 Bridgestone or Goodyear tires both models of 
 these tires are a safety problem in rain or snow.
 The car slips when it is raining, I replaced
 the tires before the Chicago winter hit and it
 is much better. The tires may be okay in the
 warmer climates that don't see snow or much
 rain...but, anywhere else they are a hazard.
 
 Now, I will be looking at the model and brand
 of tires sold with any new car. 
 
 Overall, the Honda Civic is what I was looking
 for in reliability and gas mileage on regular
 gas. The Honda Civic Si would have been a more
 fun car, but I thought it takes mandatory 
 premium gas and has the larger wheels/tires
 that tend to get messed-up on the pothole 
 landscape we call Chicago!
 
 The other car I was looking at was the Toyota
 Matrix, but the base car(4-cylinder) that got
 good gas mileage didn't have electric windows.
 I gotten used to not cranking the windows down
 manually...",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought this car new and the car has a design flaw in the rear suspension and the tires prematurely wear out. Honda knows of the problem and has a service bulletin on it and expects the consumer to pay for new tires. My car has only 20,000 miles and the rear tires are bald. I called Honda and they said they don't warrant tires but will fix the suspension for free. There's thousands of complaints on this issue and Honda is ignoring it. Well I will never buy another Honda again. If this had been a Toyota they would have had a recall by now!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Let me just start off by saying this is the most fun vehicle i have ever driven. It is very quick, has no lack of power, and it gets good gas mileage as well, 32-34 hwy. Its pretty comfy inside but the seats need more controls for lumbar, etc.... Besides that the interior is very nice and sophisticated. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a reliable gas saving sports car.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I decided to go Honda after being a Chevy gal for most my life....I love it......I got the manual transmission as I tried the automatic and found it had no pep approaching a highway.....and I love the sport of a 5pd. I got the black which is sleek and an eyecatcher. I will say I gave it almost all a solid 5 but one drawback..I am 5'1 and I find that the seatbelt which I always wear, is up too high on my neck and I have to keep pulling it down. Its very annoying. Otherwise you cannot beat it...as a matter of fact, I will be trading it in mid summer for a newer version and possibly the EX.....I want a moon roof! yOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED IN BUYING THIS FINE IMPORT!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Buyer's regrets on this one. While the fuel economy is good, I could get just about the same on a bigger car that is a lot more roomier and feels safer like a Malibu or Fusion. Also, forget about trying to fit anything in the trunk!! A lot of better choices for about the same money.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Two trips to the midwest... wow... averaged 39 mpg. This mileage included all city (Chicago etc.) and highway driving with the AC on about half the time. This car has no lack of power when needed. Very comfortable and shifting is so smooth you can only tell by looking at the tachometer **************** gears. Looking into buying a second civic.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought 2007 brand new civic w/4 miles on it. I have had rear end problems w/ it ever since. It idles terribly almost dying on you at a stop light. Have had it into the dealer 1/2 dozen times and they say that this is normal. (I don't think so). The rear end acts real squirrly specially in the rain. Even my husband feels not safe driving this car. We are ready to trade it for something else. Very rough ride, seats are very hard & uncomfortable specially on long trips.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"But the dealership is aweful things everyone is stupid never buy from freehold honda in nj, try DCH honda instead much better deal to be had there. And never buy an extended warranty on a new car, wait until the manufactors warranty runs out, you will pay less or the same but have a fresh 60000 miles to go on it instead of two that over lap",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have been a Honda owner for 15 years I have had 4 Accords all EX-L. I made a mistake on trying a different make and have come back to Honda. I sold my gas guzzling V6 Mitsubishi Galant and now have a 2007 EX Civic coupe I just wished I waited a few months i could have gotten the Civic EX-L. I love the car great gas mileage on the highway around 38 and about 28 or so in city. I can't understand the people having trouble with this car. Sure there might be a few little issues but all makes for the most part do. The people who are complaining should maybe look at how they drive or treat their cars. A friend of mine bought one after me and it looks 10 years old it's not a tank.

It has great power for the motor and the acceleration response is great.I always get great gas mileage I find it hard to believe some of you is only getting 20 miles to the gallon, I get more than that and I have a lead foot. I would recommend this car to anyone.",
2007,Honda,Civic,very hard to see out of almost hit a lady. to many blind spots. and doesn`t get that great of gas miledge as they say. I bought a corolla and so far love it.,

2007,Honda,Civic,"I have my 2007 Honda Civic Ex Cp. since Aug. Put 3,500 miles on it. I enjoy driving this car more than any car I have owned. Brake and steering response is great, acceleration for a 1.8 engine is unbelievable. Went on one 500 mile trip and gas mileage was 39 MPG, 90/10, around town and short trips I am averaging 28 MPG, 50/50. Could use a little more seat clearance for getting in and out on driver side, also road noise inside could be better. I've had a lot of commands on how great the car looks, a fun car to drive and if performance and quality hold up I will buy another Honda.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This is a great little car. I replaced a late model Civic EX for the new 2007 Si. I love the styling and think that is what sold me on the car primarily. It also is fun to drive which is the secondary reason for my purchasing the car. Having almost 200 hp linked to a six speed manual in a car this size makes driving it a lot of fun. I was disappointed, however, that Honda would not negotiate on the price at all. For what I paid, almost $25K with tax etc, I could have bought a Mustang (although I would have paid more for Mustang GT). I prefer the front wheel drive of the Honda for bad weather as well. The Mustang is terrible in the snow (I've owned one for 10 years). I got one of the two remaining Si's on the lot late in the model year. Apparently the Honday dealer felt no need to negotiate. So, it was take it or leave it. Anyway, I wound up taking a fully loaded Si with the navigation system and upgraded stereo system. Its black on black and I had the windows tinted as well. Its a very sharp looking little car especially with the low profile tires and the sporty Si wheels. The navigation system is one of the best if not the best for any car manufacturer. My only complaint about the car is that I'm a fairly big guy for a car this size. I am 5'9"" and weigh 240lbs. The side bolsters on the bucket seats are not adjustable for wide shoulders. If your some skinny little guy this is OK but if your a wide body, like a linebacker, you can use some more width in the seat back. Honda should consider making the seats adjustable in this respect. Otherwise, the car has great breaks and the rear seats fold down which is always a plus for carrying things. I've owned several Hondas, both Accords and Civics because of their reliability, ease of maintenance, and high resale value. I would expect this vehicle to be no different in this respect.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Bought it in late April and - no surprise - I love it! Bought it for 18K and pocket change. The EX upgrade of 4-wheel disc brakes, improved sound system, moon roof, etc will have been well worth the extra money come the far distant day comes when you sell it.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Having sold off my 2000 Toyota 4Runner I had forgotten how much fun driving could be. Have driven RT to Denver three times since buying it at sppeds of 70 to 85 mph I've averaged from a low of 34.6 to 39.5. In town, somewhere around 28 mpg. And you know, the car looks pretty darned stylish too.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"The only difficult part of my Civic experience was finding the rare sedan stick model, but it was well worth it. Drives like a mid range sports car. Have now owned 6 Honda family cars - 4 Hondas and 2 Acuras",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I recently purchased a 2007 Honda Civic for my wife. Ever since I first started driving, I have been a Chevy enthusiast, and not very fond of ""toy cars"". When I got behind the wheel of this Civic, I was instantly impressed. The acceleration is great, braking is impressive, it is surprisingly roomy, excellent gas mileage, the list goes on and on. We have only had one problem with it since we bought the car, (the brake switch was faulty, causing it to have problems coming out of Park). The honda service department fixed it quickly. This car was very well priced and is extremely dependable. Now, I still love Chevy (no one ever stops loving their first love :) ), but I would recommend this car to anyone.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought my '07 Civic EX coupe in May and have about 5500 miles on it. I love everything about the car. The build and materials quality make the car seem like it should cost more than what it does. I'm 6' 0"" and weigh 220lbs and i fit comfortably with room to spare. The car turns like its on rails with very little body roll, breaks like a great sports car, has wonderfully communicative steering, cruises at 75 quietly and effortlessly, and does all this while getting me an average of almost 34 mpg. The A/C is great, as is the 350 watt stereo and the feel of all the interior materials. It's simply a great car.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have owned a Corvette (which I still have), many expeditions, F150 trucks, an acura TL, Honda Accord, Vans, and driven many rental cars, I've driven them all. I recently bought a Civic EX coupe and love the car. It is Zippy, has plenty of room for me and a guest, and if I have the kids, there is room in the back. Hey, most of us drive alone most of the time, especially for work and this is one fun car. I love owning this and my vette and am extreemly happy. All my friends thought I was nuts at first, but with the little gas and the look of this coupe, its a trend setter.",

2007,Honda,Civic,"I have owned 5 Hondas over the years, and they all have one thing in common: They are excellent. Within the year, I bought a new Civic EX Nav. I am 65 and have never had so much fun driving, as with this car. I bought from Mike Piazza Honda in Langhorne, Pa, and they have given me better service when needed, than Lexus or Saturn. There are times when things go wrong that are the drivers fault. Piazza has been a model dealer. My son also got a Civic from them. A slick 2 door EX NAV and loaded. He knows that he has a car for the long term. His car has only been back for oil changes and minor maintenance. The sales/service staff are courteous, and one of the salesmen walked past me after a long time, and wished me a Happy Birthday. He was 2 days off.

2007,Honda,Civic,TRADED IN MY 2000 CIVIC AND DROVE HOME THIS 2007 BEAUTY. TOOK ME A WHILE TO BELIEVE MY SONS ADVICE AND PURCHASE A HONDA IN GM/FORD COUNTRY BUT I AM OLDER AND RETIRED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WENT AHEAD WITH IT. THE KID OWNED A 1984 CIVIC CRX THAT WAS ON THE ROAD AND RUNNING STRONG FOR 16 YEARS. THE COMPRESSOR GAVE OUT AND THE REPAIR WAS MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE CAR. BEING IN AZ HE KINDA NEEDED A WORKING A/C UNIT SO HE TRADED IN FOR A 1999 CIVIC VP AND STILL HAS IT WITH NO PROBLEMS. OH THE CRX HAD 320 K MILES AND THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING LIKE A TOP. MY 07 IS GREAT ON FUEL WITH MORE HP THAN THE 2000 MODEL. WE TAKE TRIPS TO WISCONSIN TAKING THE ROUTE OVER LAKE MICHIGAN AND THE 07 GETS A LITTLE OVER 40 PER GALLON ON LONG HAULS ON INTERSTATES. A GREAT VALUE AND A VERY DEPENDABLE PRODUCT.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I've been buying a Honda since my first Honda Accord in 1977. I currently own a 98 Accord and a 07 CRV. Last year I purchased a 2007 Honda Civic and it turned out to be my worse car buying experience. After driving the car for one year, I've averaged 19.7 miles per gallon, the car has been brought back for numerous rattles and the rear tires jump off the ground whenever I go over small bumps in the road. The car went back to the dealer several times and I was told to go home because the Idiot light didn't come on to signal that anything was wrong. A month ago, I finally took my lost and sold the car. One more thing, before you buy, sit in the car and test the head rests. You'll find that after a long trip, your neck will be screaming at you to give it a rest..",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Thank you Honda, you lost a 30 year customer.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I was a Jeep owner for my whole life. CJ-7, Wagoneer, Cherokee, Grand Cherokee. Never had a problem with my Jeeps, but for better fuel economy, I decided I'd buy a Civic 2 door. Plus, my wife (who knows nothing about cars) was nagging me to get a car instead of a Jeep. It was a base model, automatic. I am a heavy commuter, so the Grand Cherokee was not fuel efficent, plus it had 210,000 miles on it. I owned it for six months before trading it in for a Jeep Compass. The Honda was not as good as its reputation. I put over 200,000 on all of my Jeeps before trading them in. This Honda probably won't make it to 100,000. About a week after I sold it, I recieved a recall about the tires falling off. I brought it back so many times for the same problem, the transmission kept leaking and I kept hearing a rattleing noise coming from the back. The trunk leaked, and the windshield wipers stopped working right in the middle of a terrential downpour on the highway. I turned off the car, turned it back on again, and they would work fine. I did this about four times before they stopped working all together. The dealer was always rude and never fixed it properly. Contacted Honda, they ignored my 4 e-mails. I will be sure to purchase from Jeep in the future. My wife wanted a Honda Oddesey as a trade in to her Chrysler Town and Country, needless to say, we bought another Town and Country, 2008. Will never buy from Honda again. I will always buy from Chrysler in the future.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"THIS CAR IS GREAT..I BOUGHT A 2007 HONDA CIVIC SI AND HAVE HAD IT A MONTH AND LOVE IT..GREAT LOOKS HANDLING AND REALIABILITY AS WELL AS HONDA""S GREAT RESALE VALUE. THE CAR IS QUIET AND GETS GOOD FUEL ECONOMY..IT SHIFTS VERY SMOOTHLY AND HAS A GREAT STEREO..THE CAR IS MADE VERY SOLID..IT CAN ALSO GET YOU A SPEEDING TICKET IF YOUR NOT CAREFUL..I RECOMMEND A HONDA TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR REALIABILTY, RESALE VALUE AND GOOD TRANSPORTATION TO CONSIDER A HONDA...",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I debated on a Toyota, or honda. I have had a Camry in the past, but I tought I would try a Honda, they had great reviews. This was a big mistake, with in 3 months the alternator died, I had to get a tow, and what was worse, Honda never gave me a loaner. Now I have a recall for ABS, what next?From now on I am never buying a Honda product at all, not even a snowblower. From now on I will only buy Toyota's. I also wrote Honda, told them of my problems, no response from them at all. I guess when they get your hard earned bucks, they stop caring.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Very unhappy, 2007 Civic owner.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Nice car but very pricey. I bought the car new and with 2 miles. The first two weeks I owned it I had to take to the shop for repair and now I have received a recall from the factory because of the ABS brake system could casue wheels to fall off causing accident. Where is all of the famed Japanese expertise at ??????? Shows you they are like Chevy and Ford and have probelms to.,
2007,Honda,Civic,Best thing about it is the stereo. It has no back seat to speak of so why not just make it a two seater like my S2000. If you are gonna but it check out the 4 door model and not this coupe as I think it would be much more comfortable to drive and use day to day.,
2007,Honda,Civic,piece of garbage worst car made,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I know it is early but on my first two tanks of gas, I am averaging 33.3 mpg. This is a little better than advertised. I have not had the opportunity to take it on a trip yet but look forward to it. The buying experience at Pensacola Honda was the best I have ever had and I have purchased a number of new vehicles. Strongly recommend this vehicle.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I am driving a '95 Geo Prizm presently and it has been a very good and reliable car. I owned a new '76 Accord and an '82 Civic, both 5 speeds. The Accord was a first year model and a bit disappointing although I did get 150-some thousand out of it before the transmission went. I opted for my '82. I got 40 mpg, highway or city until I hit around 100,000 and then it went down to 36-37. I am skeptical about the really bad reviews I have read here. Most of the are signed AOL user. One said they only got 20 mpg. I don't believe that. They should have taken it back to Honda as soon as they found out. I think these ads are put in by competitors, although I have no proof. But more of a signature than AOL user would give more credence to the tales. I gave fictitious info so my letter would be printed.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"My wife loves her new Civic and last week it got 40 MPG on mostly highway driving. However, load it up with two people, their lugage and two bicycles on the back and our milage dropped to 25 mpg plus the trans was searching all over for the right gear. It still hit 80 with no problem but the constant shifting was annoying.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have driven many coupes through the years, and I find that the Civic EX, for it's price and size, has all, and more then a person could ask for. From it's exterior styling, to it's interior comfort, it meets and excides all claims. The Civic EX offers more for your dollar, then most cars in it's price range. Take it for a drive, you wount be sorry. From a happy buyer.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"2007 EX 4Dr w/16000 mi since Dec. (3)round-trips of a 1000 miles ea netted 40-41 mpg ave. @ 65-70 w/air running. The 75 mi daily commute averages 35 mpg. I drive economically. At 6'5"" 225 lbs, Honda provided spaciousness that Toyota's low headliner didn't. Rack and pinion steering is fast and 4 wheel discs are amazing. Very firm ride. Noisy on old rough pavement (like most of I-5 nowadays). For some reason, the windshield wiper blades are noisy. Hard to get out of the bucket seat low to the ground car but then all low cars are. You learn how. Speed control drifts and changes on hills and needs to be reset, minor inconvenience. Overall, for 19K this was a good buy and I like it better than the Volvo S40 I rented on a week long trip last year. Civic EX needs the stability control option that the Volvo had. Great on snow. The EX is marginal on black ice but then you need all the help you can get under those circumstances. That moonroof is great! Nonexistant side molding protection is regretful and you learn to ""park for protection"".",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Consumer report does half of the truth when reporting, i wish they will report on themselves for once.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I am VERY disappointed with my 2007 Honda Civic LX. I got it for the fuel efficiency, but so far, I am ONLY getting ~23 MPG (city), and I do not drive agressively and use it primarily for short commutes to/from work. The steering wheel does not adjust properly for my body, and is, for some reason, shifted slightly to the left of center; the engine sounds noisy and rough. The seat feels uncomfortable. The breaks slip as I am about to stop. I'm thinking of selling this disappointing car for a Toyota Prius. BUYERS BEWARE!",
2007,Honda,Civic,Getting the Civic is a great decision. It performs the way it was projected. I just wonder how some people who cannot even reveal their name can call it overrated. Maybe they don't know how to drive or they work for the competiion.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"so bad i have cancelled my consumer reports subscription..( who's advice i took) No power, only fair gas mileage, rough riding, very poor seating for visibility, almost twice the money for which i could have gotten a Chev Cobalt for.. which has great reviews..",
2007,Honda,Civic,The trouble with Honda these days is...because their so popular the prices are going up dramatically!! A few years ago a civic was a very affordable little car that almost anyone could afford...now the prices are up where the Accord was just a couple of years ago! Speaking of the Accord...look at the 2008 model....they have turned it into a large luxury sedan! Ridiculous!!,
2007,Honda,Civic,I purchased my 06 Civic w/Nav over a year ago.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I wasn't crazy about the colors offered. I do enjoy the car. It gets good gas milage, though the ride is rough. Before, I had an Accura, which I really enjoyed. They didn't have an afforable car with navigation. I did read that there is a recall on the 06.",
2007,Honda,Civic,I bought my first Honda Civic 04 and I really enjoyed it untill I couldn't resist the stylish look of 2007 Civic anymore. I traded the 04 for the 2007 Civic about 2 months ago and I've enjoyed it since.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"A very slick & stylish design,smooth ride,quiet engine and very good acceleration. I intend to keep this car for at least 8 years ,therefore I will most likely use synthetic oil. Job well done from Honda.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Owned my last civic for 15 years. Honda makes a wonderful car. I wanted to comment on customer service. Have found that Honda Dealers do well under warranty but after that you need to watch them. Brought my car in the have the front axles changed and we I returned found out they changed my timing belt instead?!? Humm, worn CV joints... Timing belt? Still haven't figured out how they did that one.",
2007,Honda,Civic,After being a repeat Toyota customer I went with a 2007 Civic when my Echo was hit. The Honda is an OK car but overpriced for the features.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Very poor customer service. I saw on AOL that there had been a safety issue recall but I had to call the dealership to find out if mine was affected - it was. I once had a Toyota recall that was NOT a safety issue and was notified by the dealer, the company and was treated exceptionally well.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"If I could afford to, I would trade my Honda in on a Toyota today!!!",
2007,Honda,Civic,This new 08 civic with leather and navigation is amazing. Honda has come a long way with the civic.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Great car for the price. I say the new 08 accord at arrowhead honda in peoria,az is hot and will make the car of the year. Sorry toyota, you just cant beat a honda. Thanks Mike Reppy for the great service i received at Arrowhead Honda",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I purchased my brand new Civic Si in March and I still love getting behind the wheel everyday. It's quick, very responsive, and turns heads when I zoom down the freeway! My previous car was a Mercedes and that thing was always in the shop. You just can't beat a Japanese car and Honda tops the charts!! I'll be driving this one for a long time to come!!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I purchased a 2007 EX sept 06. Now a year later and 42,000 on it already I still love it. Oil changes every 8k. I do mostly hwy and go from Richmond, Va to Cin, Ohio almost evey weekend. 497 miles. 1 tank exactly if i stay at 70-75 mph. This car zooms right along, has plenty of power for 4 cyl. Interior is great, love the split dashboard with the spedo in constant view all the time. City drivign I still get about 30-35. What more can you expect in this day in age with gas prices skyrocketing.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have no ideal what these people are saying when it comes to gas mileage, but I am a very aggressive driver in anything I drive, and I am here to say that my si gas mileage with my driving is unbelievable 197 hp and when using all power and still getting 28 to 32 consistantly is wow, I'll take that everytime. When I stay out of the power I have recieved 38 mpg. For a four cylynder it is very fast, you want faster put the turbo charger on it, the only thing I did not like about this car is the replacement of tires every 15000 miles due to 17"" rims in which I understand this is for all vehicles but not sure about the chopping tires in the rear after awhile due to honda making it so light in the rear. I cannot believe Honda did not give a leather package for this car of statured, that was very dissapointing. overall this car is great for what it is.By the way with nokian tires this car is great handling on ice and snow.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I purchased a new Civic SI sedan and boy did I get a wrong number. Gas mileage is not as advertised, only getting about 20. The car hesitates on acceleration and if you don't keep the revs up, it is very slow. Interior components are cheap and some are already falling apart. Very disappointed and will never buy another Civic SI""",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I purchased my first ever Honda ('07 Civic Hybrid) in June 07. I have drove an SUV for the past 15 years. I thought I wouldn't like driving a smaller car after all the years in an SUV, but, I have no complaints! I notice some people complaining on here about the mileage stated on the sticker is not what they are getting, but take that complaint back to the dealership where you bought it, because my salesperson was completely honest up front & told us the same thing - unless you drive like a grandma at 55 MPH on the highway, you won't get 50 MPG. He was right, and I apprecaited his honesty!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"However - here's what I do get, and I monitor my mileage every time I fill up my tank..this has been incredibly consistant for 3 months now: I consistantly get 400+ miles for every tank of gas, and this is a combo of driving in city and on highway every single day! I drive 30 miles to work one way every day, and the gas mileage is consistantly around 40 MPG. There is a gauge on the dash tht you can reset and it also keep strack of your MPG. I purchased the model with the Navi system, and it's well worth the extra $ if you travel alot - you can do away with your atlas or MapQuests! It's very easy to use with the touch screen! Just type in the address and GO!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I am also 5'10"" so I am not a small person, and I don't feel like I am in a small car, and not uncomfortable at all. I love the way it drives, and its durability. I also live in the country on a gravel road, so I really put it to the test on a daily basis! Honda is first class and I am glad I made the decision to purchase the Hybrid..best thing I have done in a LONG time!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought a 2007 Honda Civic EX in November 2006. I have had it for 10 months now and still love it. I love the modern looking design on the outside and the interior is modern too. I live in the Atlanta, GA area and I average 30 mpg drving around Atlanta which includes city and highway drving. I average 300-315 miles per fill up and when I fill up it usually holds about 11.5 gallons. The only thing I dislike is the car is too low to the ground and when parking you have to be careful if there is a curb in front of you work the bottom will hit it. Also I wish the cup holders were where the gear shift is for easier access. All in all I plan to keep this care for many years to come. I definitely recommend this car!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought a 2007 Honda Civic EX in April. It is, without doubt, the best car I've ever owned (and I've been driving for 45 years). Gas mileage on desert freeways - air conditioning full blast - is always between 40 and 41 mpg. The car is comfortable, relatively quiet, has lots of great features (e.g., sun roof, mp3 jack, two 12-volt sockets, interior air filter, etc.) and seems to be especially well built. It costs a little more than comparable sizes from other companies, but it's well worth it.",

2007,Honda,Civic,"Mileage (for me) not what expected - low 40's. But when my husband drives, he can get 60! It is definitely in the difference of the way we drive. It is true, you have to drive like ""an old grandma"" to get those great numbers (and I don't!) Otherwise, its been a great car - no problems thus far . . . . G. in St. Louis",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought an 07 Civic Ex back in May. Overall, I am satisfied with it, although it has already been back at Honda for AC issues. Honda claims that it was low on Freon but even now, although it cools off, it seems as though it takes longer than it should. I am used to my Silverado giving me frost bite on the hottest of days...this one doesn't come close.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Other than that, I like this car. It feels solid on the road, and is very comfortable. It has a much bigger car feel. I bought it for economy and it seems to be about where I expected...about 28-30 city and 35-38 hwy. The car has gotten several compliments from friends and coworkers on its sleekness. The Civic has grown up on us!!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Also worth mentioning, don't let the 1.8 fool you...",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I opened her almost all the way up one day and had to shut it down at 119mph. Even at that speed, it felt incredibly stable and solid.",

2007,Honda,Civic,I own a 2006 EX Civic 2 door in Galaxy Gray. Bought it new in November 2005. A/C control isn't up to industry leaders. Had to have the CD replaced under warranty. Also had a sun visor fall apart.,
2007,Honda,Civic,The cars style and drivability are above excellant. I am a 55 year old male and I drove from Philadelphia to Ocean City NJ round trip (put 200 miles on the odometer) and used just 4.4 gallons of gas. You do the math.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"As much as I think some of the lesser car companies have made improvements, I like to step on the gas and go and go past as many gas stations as possible.",
2007,Honda,Civic,It just does many things very well.,
2007,Honda,Civic,Oh yes almost forgot. Honda lost a law suit and must allow an additional 5% of mileage on leases and warranty work.I guess the odometer is a little to liberal.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Well I have to say for having a SI, I get great gas milage. A lot has to do with your driving habits. When I fill up completely I can get 315 Mile out a One tank.. I love my Civic, can't beat it...",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Actually, I must agree with the statement. I am going through my second NEW Civic. First was EX 2006 now I have LX 2007. First one had many problems with transmission and a little better mileage on the highway about 35-37 m/g. City was the same thing! Hardly touched 19 m/g!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I talked to the dealer in both cases, they said it's an average and normal. That the number never goes to close to 30 m/g as claimed, which would be fine if it was close to 25 m/g, but not as many times close to 15!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I like the car, but as far as the mileage goes, it's a big fat lie! Use or not use of the A/C does not make considerable changes. Tried it with and without A/C, and consumption was barely different.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Mileage SUCKS!,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Maybe you should have your car checked out. We have gotten 32 miles to the gallon consistantly. We have the Honda Civic EX. It drives great! Check your tire pressure, etc.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"If this is the car you looking for BECAUSE of the CLAIMED! fuel economy, than go for something else! Those ratings are a BIG JOKE! 30 miles in a city!? Yeah right. LOL",
2007,Honda,Civic,"If you get 230 miles on a FULL 13 GAL TANK AND I MEAN FULL to the top, than consider yourself lucky. It is ridiculous 17.7 miles in the city (Normal driving)!!! My old Honda Civic was doing much better, averaging 22 m/g in city.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Highway ONLY drive gets you an average of 30-32 m/g at the best which is not that bad nor that good!,

Price is wonderful, seats are not very comfortable but for that price, its nothing a pillow cant fix.",

Anyone over 6' or with shoulders bigger than a 10 y/o girl should take a LONG test drive first. I was able to buy a seat insert that has helped dramatically. HOWEVER, It's now a car I'd like to be driving more than around town. Oh it does hesitate like some of the others state. Also get a little surge now and then. That can be dicey in the Taco Bell drive thru. I missed not looking at the VW line. My bad.",
2007,Honda,Civic,,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Great car , sold our 04 accord coupe for a 07 civic coupe and couldnt be more pleased..Great on gas and equal to the 04 accord cp ride. Excellent venting on ac system and great gauges and control positioning. Just a fun car ..and all hondas are strong resale.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"In May 2007 I bought a Honda Civic LX, Automatic, AC, power windows, cruise were amoung the options. I traded in a Ford Focus ZX3 that was loaded, auto, air, cruise. I couldn't keep tires on the Focus, the car just ate them up and Ford Motors doesn't seem to care. So after 30 years of devotion to Ford/Mercury I bought a Honda. I am not disappointed! The Civic gets between 35-38 MPG for me, 5-8 MPG better than the Focus. The Civic has a better ride quality than the Focus and the Civic is much more efficient to service. The motor in the Civic is a quite, efficient, strong motor (what else from a Honda motor?). Bang for the buck the Honda Civic is, in my opinion, the best buy on the new car market!",
2007,Honda,Civic,,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I did research online and decided to purchase the Civic due to its rave reviews. I've had mine for three months now and I love the interior/exterior styling, the great Atomic Blue color and all the standard features on the EX model, but I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with the performance. The car hesitates at times when acclerating and I am not getting the 30 to 40 mpg Honda claims I can get. I've driven ultra conservatively and am only able to get 27 to 28 mpg with about 60/40 city/hwy. My Mom is getting better gas mileage in her new Altima! Also, the sun visors are defective. They began making a popping sound when being raised and lowered about 2 months after purchasing the car and now the visor on the passenger side will not stay in the raised position, so its back to the dealership for repair! And the one other thing I wish Honda would do, is to put the 350 watt sound system in the EX Sedan or at least offer it as an option. The sound system the sedan comes with is lousy. Maybe I should have gotten the Sentra.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Test drove this one and the corolla. Not sure which was more uncomfortable and tinny. Will keep looking.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I purchased the Civic so I didn't have to put so many miles on my Mustang. I was originally expecting a good, reliable, and economical car for running back and forth to work. It turns out, the Civic is fun to drive, great looking, and surprisingly very comfortable. The standard LX package provides a lot of standard features and incredible safety. The interior is so cool. Do yourself a favor and check one out!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"We bought an EX model about a month ago to drive around town and for our teen to drive. It's a peppy car that's good on gas and is very comfortable to drive but there are things about the car I unfortunately don't like. I've read through the reviews and pretty much agree with the issues already noted: blind spots, you can't see the front of the car because of the windshield, and the car hesitates a bit when you hit the accelerator.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This is by far the Greates little CAR I have ever owned!!!! I LOVE THE NEW DASH! Anyone who says that the dash looks like its from the Enterprise IS RIGHT ON!!! Thats why I love it... Todays cars are going back to the days of un-exciting gauges, bland round info centers. I wanted something that would make me smile everytime I get in... After 12,000 miles, I am still SMILING!!!! This car handles, drives, brakes and accelerates like a MINI SPORTS CAR. I will keep this car for a VERY LONG TIME! Go HONDA!",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have owned three Civics consecutively. I am happy to say that each experience has been better than the previous. Honda has really improved the body style of the '07 coupe, and still has managed to keep the functionality of the vehicle. The price has continued to stay affordable, and the gas mileage is great when you look at $3.00 per gallon for fuel!",

2007,Honda,Civic,"Love the car, peppy, reliable, consistently gets 28-30 mpg city, 40 mpg highway.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This is my first brand NEW car and I love it. I've read the other reviews that claim that it's not that great with gas and I have to disagree. I recently drove it from NY to Maryland (175 miles) and I barely used a 1/4 tank of gas to get there. I also do not have any problems with blind spots. I do on ocassion fell some vibration in the driver's seat, but it is hardly noticeable. It looks great and is very comfortable. All in all I am very happy with my purchase.",

2007,Honda,Civic,"I just brought home a 2007 Civic EX Coupe. I had been driving a 1999 Civic Value Package, beat up by NY streets and garages. I love my new car. Nothing bad to say about it. It has everything I wanted, and more.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"The absolute PERFECT teen car!!! Cute, sporty but most importantly SAFE :) With airbags all around it really helps ease some of my fears as I watch my new driver take off everyday. And we know from owning Hondas for over 25 years that it will be dependable and will perform for years and years to come.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Two Words, LOVE IT !",
2007,Honda,Civic,"As alot have said gas mileage is very poor we averaged 23 mpg for the first 5000 miles, it has gotten better since then. Transmission is terrible, very jerky, when you step on the gas it hesitates for a few seconds, could be very dangerous. Shifting is very jerky as well. Dealer says all this is normal. Blind spots are horrible, very unsafe. My partner was in a 10 mpg wreck and it caused $7500 worth of damage to the car, quite high for just a front left fender and all the accessories. I love the style of the car, it looks awesome, but I would never buy another one. We also have a ford focus, that is 10 times the car the civic is, more power, better gas mileage, handling, noise etc. This was our 4th Honda purchase, all others have been great cars except the civic.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This is my 4th Civic, so I splurged and went for the model with the moon roof. I have always loved my Hondas, but unfortunately I have to say that I absolutely hate this one. The new styling has blind spots on each side. When you are trying to make a left turn at a corner, or even when you're going to the left around a bend in the road, you are unable to see what's next to you and often what's coming at you due to the blind spot along the side of the windshield. There is also a blind spot on the right because you can't see the front of the car through the windshield. It is difficult to judge how far to pull out so that you have a wide enough arc to make the turn without hitting something. I personally scraped the running board area on the right side of the car on a curb to the tune of $600 because I couldn't see it as I turned the corner. I've even put the seat up as high as it will go, but I still can't see well. They're going to have to do something about this styling, or they will have a lot of lawsuits on their hands.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Other than that, I think the Mileage promised is somewhat lower than actual.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I replaced a '96 Acura Integra GSR with this Civic Si after researching many alternatives. Combo of price, performance, style unbeatable. Supremely comfy seats, every creature comfort, very smooth shifter, goes like a bat out of hell (considering the engine is well below the 350 ponies in more expensive cars), and handles like a champ. Oh, and the tuned exhaust note is something else. Sometimes it's hard to decide between listening to the exhaust and blasting the high-wattage, sub-woofered stereo.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"(I really loved the Integra and thought I'd have it forever, but it was stolen 3 times and the last recovery was sans engine.)",
2007,Honda,Civic,"Bought the black car - Habanero was garish, blue was too electric, silver was, well, silver. Got it home and noticed the subtle blue flakes just under the surface. Very classy! Heads-up speedo is a joy; in fact, all the controls and displays are superbly ergonomic. i-VTEC kicks in noticeably at 6000 rpm - a real adrenaline rush. But around-town driving can be as sedate as I want (usually I don't). Trunk is a little dinky compared to the Integra hatchback, but I was spoiled: with the seats down, the hatchback was like a mini-pickup truck.",
2007,Honda,Civic,Hint: Be sure to program the door locks to lock and unlock automatically (see the manual). It's a great safety feature.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Exterior styling took a little getting used to, but at least it's distinctive and not a euro-sport-wannabe. I have a feeling that this generation of Civic Si's is a future classic.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"This is one great car! Not only is it comfortable and attractive, it gets great gas mileage. We are extremely satisfied with our choice.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"We were thinking of getting an Accord or a Hyundia Sonata, but when we saw the Civic, we just fell in love. It looks so sporty and you can't beat the price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The roominess of the cabin and trunk is really impressive.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I just traded in my 2004 Honda Accord lease for a 2007 Honda Civic LX and I'm loving it!. Great mileage, sporty, sleek, interior looks like a cockpit. I have no regets I decided to buy it. I've driven 1500 miles already in 3 weeks. Just having a great summer with Betsy :) That's all :)",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I have a silver Honda LX coupe and it is the cutest peppiest little thing. It handles beautifully, good gas mileage, interior styling v. sporty. And if it's anything like my last Honda (owned for 12 years) the only thing it will cost me is maintenance. I give it 5 stars.-Marianne",
2007,Honda,Civic,"On Saturday 8/4/07 I traded in my 2006 Honda Pilot for a 2007 Honda Civic. I wanted better gas mileage and very glad I made the trade. The Pilot was a beautiful riding vehicle, not unlike many luxury cars. I must say I'm not unhappy with the trade at all. They quality, fit and finish on the Civic is awesome, which is typical of Honda. The Civic's dash board is awesome and really makes the drivers position actually feel roomier than that of the Pilot. I'm also extremely impressed with how quiet the cabin is of the Civic. You barely hear the engine or passing traffic or other outside noise.",
2007,Honda,Civic,This is my 3rd Honda and I'm going to stay loyal to the brand.,
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought a 2007 Honda Civic Ex in July 2007. I really love the car and had shopped around and also looked strongly at the Toyotas and Mazdas. But I ended up going with Honda because I knew their cars had a great resale value plus I was wanting something with great gas mileage. I had leather seats installed which I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to make their Civic look and feel upscale. I love the way the drives and the interior is great. I have only two real complaints and that is the MPG has not been near what was conveyed by Honda and I have had my car nearly six weeks now and have yet to come even close to the 30/40 MPG. That has been very disappointing to me. Since I bought my Civic EX I have come across other people who have the same complaint with their Hondas. Also there is definitely a blind spot for the Driver when looking to your right to pass. Honda needs to address that in the future. Overall, I am satisfied but just wish I was getting better gas mileage.",
2007,Honda,Civic,"I bought my Civic in Sept 06, and I must say I love everything about it. Until then, I was extremely loyal to Domestic vehicles, but considering the safety features, smooth ride, gas milage, and last but never least, the resale value of this vehicle made my purchase very easy!! I can't say enough good things about it!!",

2007,Honda,Civic,"The Honda Civic is not my first car, but it is my FIRST New car. I had alwaya wanted one but for my first purchase I was considered a compact SUV simply for the practicality of being able to haul things. I am so glad that I decided on my Honda Civic....it's the best car ever made....I have only had to fill up once and I purchased the car 7 days ago. I bought this car with 17 miles on the odometer and I now have over 400......The gas mileage is great and so are the features. Standard ABS is also a plus! The Jeep Liberty had it as an option. If looking to buy something practical for gas, compact and sporty....The Honda Civic Coupe is perfect!",
2007,Honda,Civic,I bought a 2007 Honda Civic and just love it. It drives quite easily and i am impressed by how great the brakes work....they are the best of any car I have ever driven. It is comfortable and so easy to drive in the city. I would definitely buy one again!,
2007,Honda,Civic,"Needing to replace my 2000 Saturn SC2, I was looking for something fun and peppy. At first I considered the PT, but it didn't have enough HP. I also didn't want the SI when my son told me it used only Premium gas, (you can use 89 or less, but it is supposed to affect performance) but didn't care once I drove the car! With 197 HP, it has all the pep I need for the price. It is darn cute, especially the inside, and love the color, ""Habanero Pearl"". The sport seats are the most comfortable I have sat in, even compared to BMW's, in fact, I think the car drives like a 3 series. It is FAST and handles GREAT. Good sound system with the added subwoofer standard.",

What next. No more Japanese cars for me. Going back to GM.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"I always heard Honda stood for quality, so I purchased a two door Civic EX...top of the line with sunroof alloys etc. The cloth interior looked great so thats what I got. Two weeks after taking delivery of the car the cloth began to wrinkle. The dealer said ""they all do that"", but replaced it as a curtesy.....bull. It is still isen't right. When the car is warmed up, while at idle, the car vibrates violently. I took my friend and his mother shopping one day and while waiting for a light his mother said ""Ron, there is somthing wrong with your new car. I asked, what do you mean. She answered,""your car is vibrating"". I took the car to the dealer and they told me thats normal for this car. Why can't they adjust the idle...answer from the dealer, ""there is no idle adjustment"" and we can't fix it. I now have 13,000 miles on the car and I heard noises that sounded like they were coming from the front end. I brouht it to the dealer and they told me I needed new front struts....at 13,000 miles!!! HELLO! Its a shame Honda has sacraficed quality for the almighty dollar. I would NOT recommend this car. There are other cars which do not cost as much as the civic, that are better quality and handle just as well or better. I even had the factory Rep. come and see my car. It took 3 months to get an appointment and when the appointment finally arrived it was ludicris. He would not go for a test drive or even sit in the vehicle. He asked me what I wanted him to do, and I said,""fix the vibration"". He simply said,""NO"" with an attitude. My suggestion is to spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",

2008,Honda,Civic,"The Honda Civic GX is a awesome car, I bought mine and a Phil Gas station and am paying about $0.80 a Gasoline Gallon Equivlent (GGE).
 
 The only shortcoming is the lack of a large tank, the 3600PSI CNG tank only holds around 8 GGE which results in about 220-250 miles per tank.
 
 Since I previously owned a Honda Civic Hybrid my good driving habits are partially responsible for my good mileage.
 
 If you are interested in Green, don't select a hybrid or a clean diesel but try a NGV. There are a few really nice perks to owning the NGV, especially if you own the Phil station.
 
 1. You are totally unteathered from the gasoline and it's issues. The price of gas may go to $5+ and as a NGV driver you are still paying about $1 per GGE.
 
 2. CNG burns cleaner than any gasoline or diesel and in the end will probably cost less to run than plug in electric cars.
 
 3. There are many government incentives to invest in a NGV, like the 7k tax credit from the federal and some states even offer thier own incentives. Also many power companies offer discounted costs on natural gas if you have a Phil station.
 
 The best however is the fact that you are helping the environment and Americans most of our natrual gas is home grown.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"It felt great in the Honda parking lot. The seats, steering wheel and the exterior looks. My wife wanted it and shortly after owning it, she wanted to quit driving it. She reported feeling like she was in a mixer causing her to get sick on her way to work. So I took it and wow was it noisey. It felt solid but thought it was to rough and harsh a ride.
 We had Toyotas and love a soft and compliant ride.
 I wish we had a car that didn't punish you when it hits the little cracks or God forbid, the bumps in the road. Other than that it was great. I'm glad I found a way to keep out the road noise, wish Honda would respond to this big problem instead of putting their ears in the sand.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"We have owned 3 Acuras and decided to buy a Honda Civic for our son to use going back and forth to college.

2008,Honda,Civic,"I have previously owned 2000 and 2004 Civic EX coupes and have loved them. My 2008 is a total letdown. It has the loudest, roughest ride of any car I have owned, including older Corvettes. The road noise is terrible. The entire car has been cheaply made. It seems loaded with plastic. Corners have been cut everywhere. It looks great from the outside, but that's the only positive about this car. The seats are too hard. The trunk requires forced slamming while the gas pedal has no tactile feedback. The sun visors are very stiff to use. The seat belt and directional noise chimes are much louder than my 2004. Actually irritating. The high beam indicator on the directional stick goes on easily with either a push or pull while turning. It is often accidentally left on. This will get the police cars attention. The blue dash lights are childish looking and cheap. The steering is very touchy. Hang on. There is no cargo net standard in the trunk, which is also lined with some cheap cardboard junk. 
 I really regret buying this car and hate driving it anywhere.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"After having 4 Accord Coupes in the last 16 years (and loving each one of them), it came time for a new one. I was less than impressed with the new ""bloated"" size of the Accords and missed the nimble agility that the older ones possessed. I liked the newer body styling of the Civic Coupe, and after driving one, I bought one immediately. The 1.8 liter has plenty of power for street/highway travel, gets GREAT gas mileage, has plenty of room for me & my friends and a ton of luggage, and has exceptional handling. The only suggestion I would make to Honda is more noise-insulation in the floorboard under the carpeting, but it is still quieter than other vehicles in the class and price-range that I have drive or rode in. So far, mine only has 1,400 miles and I hope to ********** for at least another 100,000 miles (and if it's like my last 4 Accord Coupes, it'll give me more than that!). Inherent quality, great styling, and fun-driving vehicles have made me a loyal Honda owner.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"-Needs more leg room. 
 -I don't like the location of the trunk/gas tank door release. It shares the same lever and is hard to reach.

Honda Civiv EX coupe with the 5 speed auto.Ive been racing drag cars and sport cars for over 40 years and have to say with a little work you could take the Civic right to the track and win.Like any car made there are a few areas that could be inproved,like road noise and the hand brake position.But I added a Magna Flow exhaust and a cold air intake to the engine so thats what I hear when I step on it.
 Our first tank of gas averaged out to 36 mpg.Mixed driving with the air on.Oh, and I put beautiful chromed 18"" wheels and tires on. I get more high fives from the young set driving the Civic then I do driving my Corvette convertible.One more thing, there are hundreds of after market stores selling every thing you could dream of for the Honda.

2008,Honda,Civic,"I just bought my 3rd Honda. The other two are accords and I am very satisfied. The new one is a Civic and so far it is great. It handles well, has most of the necessary creature comforts and I love driving by the gas stations. Instead of whining about gas prices, people should take action and buy fuel efficient. Conservation and efficiency recently resulted in less demand for gas and , surprise, surprise, less demand meant a drop in crude. If your ego demanded that you have own the huge gas eaters that Detroit was selling, so be it. 
 But quit whining and take action. You don't have to be a member of the MENSA Society to figure this out.I feel bad for any American worker who may lose their job, but where in God's name was the management of GM and the others in thinking they coule continue to pawn off these gas guzzlerss to the American Ego. 
 A word of caution when you go out to buy your Honda. Dealers are trying and in some cases getting a premium for the Honda's. Make sure you get them to honor any National deals that Honda is offering. Some are not and are putting a $500 above MSRP premium. There are dealers that will back off their greed, make sure you find one.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"When we needed a new car fast (older Altima totalled by a truck) we didn't even hesitate..went a bought a new Civic as the gas prices were already rising. We now have 2600 miles on it and are happy so far. Just took our first long trip and averaged 39.9 miles per gallon AT 65 TO 70 JMILES PER HOUR ON THE ROADS (legally). WOW!! Who would have believed it!! My wife was right when she said ""we're going to Honda, and no one else."" funny, we're back where we started in the early 70s, and gald we are.

My boyfriend lives 3 hours away and I get there in 1/2 a tank, barely noticeable considering gas prices.

2008,Honda,Civic,"What can I say? I lived in Manhttan for 14 years and never owned a car until I moved down to Florida in 2003. My very first car was the 2003 Camry XLE and I absolutely loved it. My parents wanted it so I had to purchase a new car. I did a ton of research and here are the five reasons I picked this car:- ""Car of the Year 2006""- 140-hp, 1.8-Liter, 16-Valve SOHC i-VTECÂ® Engine- Two-tier instrument panel - Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle (ULEV-2) in all 50 states- Exceptional fuel economy (30 mpg city/40 mpg highway*)I added the following, which were added on by the dealership. Leather Seats, XM Satellite Radio (EX is XM Ready), Rea--Wing Spoiler, Wheel Locks, Splash and Door-Edge Guards, Chrome Exhaust Finisher, Trunk Tray, Interior Gauge Trim Kit, Auto Day/Night Mirror and Pin Stripes.I had originally wanted an EX-L (for leather) but could not find an EX-L with Navigation in Royal Blue Pearl in Florida and was told I needed to wait 30 to 60 days for one.I opted for the Royal Blue Pearl EX and added the leather and got an awesome GPS to go with it.Let me tell you, the car turns heads. The color was VERY important to me because the 2008 Civic looks TOTALLY Awesome in Royal Blue Pearl. It comes standard with alloy wheels and sun roof. The electroluminescent speedometer is gorgeous at night and it tells you EXACTLY how fast you are going.I test drove the Si but did not care for the all black interior with red lighting. I much prefer the grey interior with gorgeous blue lighting. I also did not like the fact that Si only comes in manual transmission and uses more gas (higher horse power: 197 HP). I also prefer the Sedan's rear design more than the Coupe's. The steering wheels have cruise control buttons on the right and audio controls on the left. The ONLY things I wish I could have had were power seats and less of a bumpy ride. It is a totally fun, gorgeous AND a practical car. What more can you ask for when gas prices are $4 plus?",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Great car Honda !!! I don't miss my Camry at all. This is the first car I've owned that I have been pleased with just about every aspect. The car has a lot of zip for a 4 cylinder. The interior is roomy and comfortable. My 6'2"" husband had no problem behind the wheel and praised the comfortable seats. I'm small and love how the seats and steering wheel adjust. No more having to prop myself up with pillows and up tight against the steering wheel. I recline comfortably and have a good view, better view, of the road ahead and at the sides. The exterior of the car has a smart sporty look. Lift up that hood. Maintenance will be a dream. Every thing is located in easy to reach positions. Labor costs will concieveably be less. Again, thank you Honda.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"I've driven 2,800 miles so far. Mileage has been from a low of 32 mpg (while in Phoenix driving with the air conditioning on ""maximum"") to a high of 44 mpg driving without air on the highway. So far the only problem has been a fuel sensor which required replacement. The dealer didn't have the part in stock so took one of another car and installed it on mine. I hope it wasn't used.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Over the years I've owned many cars, some very expensive luxury cars and some inexpensive cars. In my opinion the Honda Civic is dollar for dollar the best car I've ever owned. Fantastic mileage and good comfort. GM and Ford should watch their backs. The gas guzzlers are a thing of the past. I don't need a car with 8 cylinders unless I'm pulling a trailer or racing.",

2008,Honda,Civic,"Dont let the 1.8 Engine fool you its very zippy. Nice shifting Auto trans,Good handleing. On first road trip 36.6 mpg driving 75 mph.... Nice",

2008,Honda,Civic,"I am on my fouth honda since I purchased my accord new in 1998. I just purchased a 08 civic coupe exl with the navi system. I love it.!! I looked at the nissan altima, pontiac g6, toyota coup and the jetta.But kept coming back to the civic. I have had it for almost a month and am very happy with it. It is sporty but has plenty of room. I never get tired of driving it or looking at it. It has plenty of power and all the bells and whistles. I can't say enough about it. I would highly recommend it to everyone.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Bought my 2008 Civic LX Sedan about a week ago. It's definitely different than my 2002 Honda Accord LX V6. The car has a lot of get up an go for a small car witha 140 HP engine. The ride is little stiff (can definitely feel the bumps in the road) and a little noisy, but what do you expect from a compact car. I love the feel of the Civic and the way it looks. Some people might feel that they are sitting a little low in the car when compared to the window heights. I just might not be used to the car yet since I am coming from a larger sedan in the Accord. The fold in side mirrors are definitely a plus for tight parking spots.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Tested the Toyota Corolla S and the noise was the same level. Choosed the Civic over the 2008 Corolla because Toyota was going to redesign the Corolla for 2009 plus recently released reports say that Toyota's quality is on the slide down hill. Additionally, all the safety options come standard in Honda cars where Toyota makes you add them on as options.",

2008,Honda,Civic,"We looked at the new 08 Accord but it was too large for us so we got the 08 Civic at $1000 under invoice! We are very impressed with the design. More power, better handling, incredible style, great gas mileage and a great buy!",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Honda did a really good job on this car. i bought it yesterday and drove the Cajon Pass to Los Angeles 226 on my odometer but still I have less half a tank full. My navigator was fabulous and so is the interior design and the way it made turns and the handling was great. Thanks to DIAMOND BAR HONDA for their excellent service - Kyle, Dion, Jason, Mr. Parks and Michael, this is the second car i bought from them and they never let me down",
2008,Honda,Civic,"Just traded my 2004 civic EX for 2008 model and what an improvement. Car handles well, much more power than 04 model. Ride is somewhat quieter and gives a much more solid ride. Steering radio controls are nice, and like the digital speedometer readout. The shape of the elogated windshield takes a little getting used to but otherwise a great car. My only complaint/concern is that no side moldings makes me worry that the car could get dinged by others very easily in a parking lot.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"I lease a 2008 Civic LX sedan. It takes the place of a 2005 DX-VP sedan. I would have gone to the hybrid, but the rear seat does not fold down.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"This is a great automobile. I'm 6'4"" 250 lbs. and the spaciousness of the front seat interior is remarkable. This car has many features that the 2005 did not - the telescopic steering wheel is wonderful, I love the unique MPH readout - map light location is very good - most everything power except the seat adjustment which is a manual up and down lever. MPG seems to be better than 2005, which was close to 40mpg highway driving in Wisconsin weather.",
2008,Honda,Civic,"One minor quibble: the emergency brake stick. For some reason, my knee bangs against it. I solved the issue by spending $1.88 for a piece of 1"" diameter foam pipe insulation cut to 5"" long which slips over the lever and looks like a piece of factory equipment in charcoal gray. Works like a charm. There is nothing that I don't like about the Honda cars. The ergonomics (despite minor quibble) are top notch. I rented a Nissan Murano for a trip a year ago to compare stuff.It was ok, but my Civic remains the choice for me (and my labrador.)",
2008,Honda,Civic,"One surprise: The wipers are the ""American"" style of the 60's?? as opposed to the ""sweep the same way style"" of the last genetration. I have no feeling one way or the other. Just a surprise.",
2008,Honda,Civic,Perhaps they will figure out a way to make the Civic Hybrid with a fold down rear seat.,
2008,Honda,Civic,I remain a very satisfied driver - and booster of Honda innovation and technology.,
2009,Honda,Civic,"1st time Civic owner, in late 50's...love my 2009 Coupe EX and it handles simply fantastic on curvey roads and hills. In summer getting 35 - 39 mpg in everyday driving and in low 30's in winter months. (very satisfied especially when gas is $3.60/gal) The 4 cyl provides plenty of power and if I had a bunch more, I would definetly get into a lot of trouble. This car is so razor sharp in the curves, It's like driving a slot car. I love it. What a fun car to drive.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I grew up in a house that drove only Honda's: obviously due to their reliability, safety, lifetime value, etc. So after I graduated from college and bought my first car I wanted to branch out and try something different so I bought a NEW car from GM. I have never been so disapointed in my life, the car constantly had problems and when it came time to trade it in it seemed impossible. It did not hold it's value at all and I was stuck. I was FINALLY able to sell it to a private buyer and then was thrown back into the market again. I looked at the 2009 Ford Focus, Toyota Camry, and Honda Civic due to their similarities and good gas mileage. After driving the Civic Coupe I knew it was the one and purchased it immediatly! I know understand why my parents only drove Honda's, I have had not one problem with my Civic and I drive it ALL THE TIME! I have also been in two accidents and have been shocked both times to see how little damage was done to my car compared to the other and just how safe it really is! I am OBSESSED with my Civic and have never gotten so many compliments in my life! It is not only a beautiful car but is also a reliable one! What more could you ask for? I also have two big dogs and often haul them around in my car and if you took a look in my car you would never know! If you are in the market for a new car I strongly urge you to check out the Civic, you definatly will not be disapointed!!!",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Now have 22,000 miles. Driven it to Phoenix, Portland, Denver and Reno from Salt Lake. Great mileage. Had one problem (loose rear shock making thumping noise) which was fixed by the dealer. Get over 30 miles around town, and on the Phoenix trip got over 40 miles per gal. The only complaint I have is the road noise. I can live with that for the mileage I get. I like the cd player, seating, trunk space, color, quality, handling, but most of all the mileage.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I accidentally put this under 2008 instead of 2009.
 Here is the correction.
 
 The Honda Civic GX is a awesome car, I bought mine and a Phil Gas station and am paying about $0.80 a Gasoline Gallon Equivalent (GGE). The only shortcoming is the lack of a large tank, the 3600PSI CNG tank only holds around 8 GGE which results in about 220-250 miles per tank. Since I previously owned a Honda Civic Hybrid my good driving habits are partially responsible for my good mileage. If you are interested in Green, don't select a hybrid or a clean diesel but try a NGV. There are a few really nice perks to owning the NGV, especially if you own the Phil station. 1. You are totally untethered from the gasoline and it's issues. The price of gas may go to $5+ and as a NGV driver you are still paying about $1 per GGE. 2. CNG burns cleaner than any gasoline or diesel and in the end will probably cost less to run than plug in electric cars. 3. There are many government incentives to invest in a NGV, like the 7k tax credit from the federal and some states even offer thier own incentives. Also many power companies offer discounted costs on natural gas if you have a Phil station. The best however is the fact that you are helping the environment and Americans most of our natural gas is home grown.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Just taken over a lease on a 2009 Civic from my wife who changed her mind! 
 Car has done only 197 miles.
 Poor ride quality
 Significant road noise
 Noisy engine even at low revs.
 No central locking on LX Value Package model. Honda dealer says this is normal??
 
 Some good points, good design, very roomy for small car.
 Would not buy this car and am looking to hand it back to the dealer..expensive!",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Just bought the EX-L with Navigation, and have been driving it for 200 miles so it's not like I have had a lot of time with it but so far it seems like a good car. 
  Obviously it's hard to really get psyched and pumped to drive a honda civic because lets face ******** not particulary fast or stylish, but it gets you where you want to go, saves gas and is very comfortable. People are complaining a lot of road noise while driving and maybe it's just me but that really seems like nitpicking, it's not that bad.
  One thing I really don't like so far is the lack of interior features...things like intermitent wipers or a trip computer that gives average mpg or even power seats. For a fully loaded car I would think these things should be standard. The heated seats have only two settings high and low so I don't know how that's going to be in the winter.
  Finally the navigation system with the voice recognition is pretty cool but a little gimmicky. For some reason the car has to repeat everyhting you tell it before it does it resulting in a ten second gap between you saying something and the car doing it. I like the bluetooth phone link but couldn't they have made it so the caller info appears on the honda screen rather than you searching for your phone in your pocket or on the seat which kind of defeats the purpose of trying to keep your eyes on the road?
  Anyway for now that's the review you can email if you want if you have questions but overall, I'm pretty happy with my choice and have no buyers remorse or regrets.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Bought 2003 civic ex 4dr sedan new. Average 38-40 mpg on regular gas with trips to Las Vegas from Texas. Just love that flat rear floor for our 2 dogs and also people. Comes well equipped just added tinted windows and a casstte tape p;ayer for all my old tapes. 44,000 miles and only regular maintenance performed.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Smooth ride, lots of leg room. Only thing is that it doesn't get the advertised mileage of at least 32 mpg...acceleration okay, brakes not as good as I'e like. But for a car that I bought just so I could get around, it's not too shabby.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I didn't believe it when my tires started to wear out and getting brake squealing noises with less than 12,000 miles. The dealer replaced the brake linings and front tires since this was not covered under the warranty. Not getting the fuel milage as Honda list with this vehicle. Performance of the 4cyl is very sluggish. My John Deere tractor has a more comfortable ride than this car ! ! !
 No more Honda's in my lifetime unless it is a lawn mower.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I bought my Civic sedan LX 6 months ago and at 9600 miles began hearing some squeaky brakes. I took it to the dealer at 9900 and he said the front brake pads were worn out - like this was no strange thing. What a let down this is - for a car touted as a low cost of ownership car on commercials - this cost $269 - I have owned more than 5 new cars in my life and never changed front pads this early. My girlfriend's Lexus has 30,000 miles and she hasn't changed pads yet. I'm just a normal, older driver, not a hard driver. I think Honda has to look into this.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Honda Civic is fun to drive and it is built with quality unlike the other compacts in its class. The navigation system is easy to use. However, it is missing some items such as glove box night, ambient light and backlit light for the passenger's switches.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"$14,000 is still too high for a stripped Civic...missing a lot of features that you get on an American Car and their much higher in repair costs at the dealers. Last Honda I'll own. It should only be price at $10,000 out the door for a stripped Civic with a tops of $14,000 for a loaded Civic! Period!",
2009,Honda,Civic,"bought for college daughter, she LOVES it,great car but missing some features that are standard on american cares, safety features and economy and things like that are good on this car,style and the mechanics of the car is why I bought it, it is the car college kids want, it met my basic requirements safety,style,good value not good for a family car,",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I hate to see other people driving it,",
2009,Honda,Civic,"After buying American cars for years, I bought a Honda to see what the comparisons would be. Aftr 5,000 miles, it has become apparent that many of the features I took for granted on my American cars just were not included, such as: daytime running lights, backlit window controls and a glove box light. The gas milage comes no where close to advertised, especially if you are hauling 3 or 4 people around and engine power is missing compared to my past vehicles. Many little things are missing and have made the car an overall disappointment. My next car will be American again.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"The best Civic yet. The fine tune 2009 Civic is a smooth riding , stylish, quiet and dependable automobile. I owned a 2008 Civic Hy Brid and found too many faults in performance and manufacturing to keep it. I went BACK to the Civic EX and glad of the decision. I have owned several Honda cars over the past 20 years. The 2009 Honda Civic EX is the best one yet. As long as you are not looking to carry 5 or more passengers; the civic has the interior comfort for four. The instrument cluster continues to be clear and very readable. most commented about when people see the interior of the Civic. I am happy that I traded my Hy Brid for the ""regular"" Civic EX. Thanks Honda.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Best fun car to drive for the money. Quality abounds along with great fuel economy. Best value for the money. Fun car to drive with 6 speed manual. Like everything about it. Drives like a more expensive car. A few things I noticed since I have 1200 miles on it. Needs to have glove box light, lights for passenger and rear window switches. Only driver side window switch is lighted. Vanity mirrors need lights.
 Would like to have a control switch for day time driving lights, permenently on all the time. Would like to put on Fog lights without headlights being also. Overall the Si model is a drivers car.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"Great, fun little car to drive. Excellent handling. I love the dash. You just simply can't beat a Honda product. Between this '09 Civic and an '07 Honda Accord, life on the road is a joy.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I've had this car a month now and have put about 1300 miles on it. I'm averaging 34 MPG driving about 60% highway and 40% city. I only have two small complaints. I could use a little more leg room, ******** satisfactory. Also, the tires are pretty loud on rough pavement. Other than ********** a great and economical car. I plan on giving it to my son in 4 years when he gets his drivers license. It will be a great car for a teen.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"I just bought a 2009 Honda Civic Last week and so far I love it, Took a small trip and got 39.7 mpg.
 Car still only has 500 miles on it, taking it on
 a 700 mile trip next month, once I get out of WV
 I should get in the 40's on gas. My son bought a new corolla and loves it just as much. I liked the dash 
 setup on the Civic better. I had 2 Honda accords.
 So I know how dependable Honda is.",
2009,Honda,Civic,"My first tank in town. produced 29mpg! It has big interior space. We traded in a big Lexus and this Civic had every gizmo and device it had. We were shocked at the standard features on this car. We are very pleased. We spent a lot of time looking on lots and online, this was overall the best for price, mileage and overall features!",
2009,Honda,Civic,Just picked up my '09 Honda Civic 2 dr and honestly.. I love it! I'm coming down from a mid-size car and wanted better gas mileagae without losing the ride and comfort... The Civiv is huge inside and gives a great ride... keep an eye on the speedomenter as this little guy likes to creep up there. It's so smooth you won't notice and you're well above the limit. *****5 Stars*****,
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I have had my 2007 Honda Civic Hybrid for almost 2 years now. I drove an SUV for 15+ years, so this was my first venture into a smaller car. I researched it online when the gas prices were nearing $3/gallon. They were starting to become scarce at that time, but I was lucky enough to find one that just came back on a trade in. Someone bought it, put 7,000 miles on it & traded it back for the larger Accord. Their loss was my gain! Right now, it costs me about $20-22 to fill the tank at about $1.90/gallon, and can last me about 400 miles. Sometimes I tend to drive too fast, so the gas mileage efficiency decreases some. It's still awesome and fun to drive - AND, its not ugly like the Prius! ha ha! I have had people offer to buy my Civic Hybrid from me, and I say ""no way!"". I love this little car, and how maintenance free its been through about 74,000 miles so far! The Civic Hybrids seem to be pretty hard to locate right now. Our local dealership never has any in stock when I am there. I have one with the Navigation system and XM, and I love it! I would recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting one with the Navi system. You will love it!",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Have had the 2007 Civic Hybrid for 2 1/2 years and have 67,000 miles on it. Getting over 50 mpg on highway and 48 local. Battery pack seems to be fine. Fun to drive, rides smooth and has already paid back the initial differential, besides being better for the earth.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Owned for one year. 12000 miles. 44.5 mpg at 5000' with 48"" of snow per year. No repairs. Excellent handling, comfortable. 
 
 My teenage daughter drives a 2004 Civic Hybrid just like one I sold to buy this car. She averages 38 mpg rushing around. 
 
 Good acceleration, climbs mountain roads and descends averaging 44-46 overall on those trips.
 
 State and federal tax incentives. This car rocks!",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"This car has been wonderful to drive, has gotten excellent gas mileage and is reliable. Only a few recalls on the vehicle, but all have been handled by the dealership with very minimum downtime. I would recommend this car or the new cng to anyone that is looking for fuel efficiency and a roomy interior.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I have owned my Silver 2007 HCH for one year now and it averaged 45.9 mpg over that year. I only get a high of about 55 mpg during nice weather, no A/C or heat on. About 48 mpg during hot weather with A/C on and only about 42 in the winter with heat on. My driving is suburban flat country near sea level. Warming the cold engine up seems to make for the poorest mileage. Acceleration hits mileage very hard too. Use the instant mpg guage! The first 5000 miles were not as good either. I wish this car was available with a sun roof. Also the carpet is very cheap. It's an ecomomy car, however, and shouldn't expect too much. I've had 2 problems, both covered under warrenty. A transmission sensor went bad causing the engine not to restart automatically after stopping and then it ran on the engine only with no electric boost. The driver's window would hang part way up in the front and cause it to tilt out of the track but it always came back down properly. This was intermittent.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I have about 50K miles on my 2007 Civic Hybrid and have averaged about 48.5 miles per gallon since I purchased the car new in late 2006. I regularly get upwards of 51-52 mpg on most tanks of gas doing a combination of highway and city driving, with a 90-mile roundtrip commute everyday. 
 
 I've had to adjust my driving style a bit to maximize fuel economy but can still drive about 70 mph on the highway without losing fuel economy.
 
 I purchased an extended warranty to cover the hybrid battery through 150K miles to make sure the car is fully covered until I have it paid off. Maintneance is a little more expensive than for my previous cars (all Toyotas) but my savings on gas alone has been worth the investment in the Civic.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I've owned this car for 15 months and every month that goes by, I get worse gas mileage. The dealership says everything on the car is working perfectly and they refuse to do anything about the poor gas mileage. My regular gas powered Civic got just a good gas mileage as this thing. The new car sticker advertised 49 Hwy and 51 City MPG.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Bottom line is, don't count on getting your money's worth with the Honda Civic Hybrid. The Prius is a much better choice.",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"What a grat car! I always said that I would not by a Japanese car, but then I test drove this car. WOW! Good acceleration and handling. But the gas mileage... When they say 50 mpg, they are not kidding. We have had our 6 weeks now, put 5500 miles on it and have averaged right at 50.5 mpg. It's a shame that an American car company couldn't do this, isn't it?",
2007,Honda,Civic Hybrid,I purchased my Civic in February. I am very happy with my purchase. I commute 100 miles round trip per day. I went from filling up my old car twice a week to just one a week with my hybrid. I usually can go between 460 and 500 miles on one tank of gas. I spent the extra money on the Nav system with voice responce and it was well worth it. I average about 45 / 46 mpg on hyway and 42/ 43 between hyway and city.,
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Back in 08 when gas started its climb to $4/gal, I had a Honda Ridgeline on lease. Poor fuel economy and unforeseen miles use, made me dump the lease and buy the Civic Hybrid in March of 08. EPA was 40-45mpg. Upon purchase it got 38 on its first tank, thanks to the mild weather mostly city driving. I drove like grandma, and babied it to try to reach 40, my best was 39. On long trips, driving under 65mph got me 38mpg. Then the summer came in May with temps over 85F every day till November. My average for the 6 month summer was 34. CVT tranny makes it run like a go-cart or moped with no gear change. I have to get the engine to 4000RPM to merge in traffic on the highway, sounds like its winding out. Then the hybrid battery started to degrade. I ignored the request from Honda to bring the car in to ""flash"" the computer and just waited for the battery to degrade and it got replaced before the 80000mile deadline just 2 months ago. I must say this car is very reliable, it now has 76000 with minimal maintenance and no breakdowns. Just not worth the extra $5000 for the hybrid model.",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I have owned Hondas and Toyotas. Hondas consistently provide superior, more stable, safer handling, over various driving conditions. This was my primary reason for choosing the Civic Hybrid over the Prius. I drive a combination of city and highway. The government rates the Civic Hybrid at 40 mpg city and 45 mpg highway. I don't get 40 mpg in the city. I get 36 mpg in the city. But compared to nearly all other cars, 36 real world mpg in city driving is pretty phenomenal. On the highway I average a little more than 45 mpg. Overall, I average right at 41 mpg. That's real world overall average of 41 mpg. Again, that's pretty phenomenal compared to just about any other car. The Civic is not huge, but not tiny. Interior is spacious and very comfortable. All of my Hondas have been very reliable. Yes, something minor may need service occasionally, but I have never had a Honda just flat out break down, or not run adequately. My 2008 Civic Hybrid is a GREAT car.",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Real world overall average mpg exceeding my expectations. Excellent handling. Excellent driveability. I like a small car, but I want it to have superior handling and control. I have owned Accords in the past. The Civic Hybrid delivers the superior handling and control that I want. The Civic Hybrid is also responsive and has good pickup. It is not a high-performance sports car, but it is more than sufficient to meet all the demands of driving in all city traffic conditions.",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I purchased a slightly used 2008 HCH currently has about 7500 miles now had under 4800 miles when I purchased it. Been very pleased with MPG, still learning how to maximize the fuel mileage. Doing between 47 to 53 MPG, but goal is 60+. Not sure what is wrong with the guy getting only 30 MPG, since if I drag raced I could still get higher than that. Important part is to manage the battery by giving the car times to regenerate power while coasting and stopping. Battery gets low more fuel used and less help on accerating. Also tint the windows to legal levels to reduce AC demand and set AC on like 75 or higher. Also keep in mind windshield Defrost runs AC too. All battery loads will affect fuel mileage. Have few complaints that the doors feel cheap, and very low to the ground. Getting what seems like bearing noise from back of the car. Seats sure could be more comfortable, wish I had gotten one with Leather seats in stead of cloth. Rated lower on Quality due to some of the road noise and ride is harse, but hoping it will be durable. I have a 3 to 5 year plan then sell, and hope ne designs are out by then. As far as comfort get a lumbar pillow you low back will thank you. Love getting 550 to 600 miles on a tank of gas.",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,this is a great car i get believe it or not on average 58mpg true i drive like a little old lady and never over 60 on the hiway if you slow down you get the miles no bs frank roche raynham ma,
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"We bought a Civic Hybrid in May and it is getting no place near the gas millage we were told it would get. On a good day we might get 30 MPG, does anyone have any suggestions?",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"We had previously owned 2 Hondas and decided to get rid of our Saturn Vue. We purchased a 2008 Civic Hybrid. The car has lived up to everything Honda said it would. We are averaging 42.2 mpg.
 
 The car is comfortable, handles well, has adequate power and aceleration. With the hybrid being built in Japan, the fit and finish is outstanding.
 
 You cant go wrong purchasing this vehicle.",
2008,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Purchased new Civic Hybrid about six weeks ago. With 300 miles/week commutes and several out-of-town trips to visit family, have accumulated some 4,000 miles already. Daily commute is 30 miles one-way, with 20 of that being Interstate. Am getting roughly 43 MPG at 70 MPH, 47 MPG at 65 MPH, and 52 MPG at 60 MPH. Have yet to see a tank's MPG fall under 40 MPG, despite all types of driving and weather (haven't seen winter yet -- that may be different).Only complaint is the position of the headrests as apparently being mandated by the safety gurus. It's uncomfortable unless you recline the seat a bit.Overall, am extremely pleased with the purchase thus far!",

While I can't speak for the few who have had problems with theirs, I can say that I love my car. I have a 40 mile commute each way to/from work, which is why I picked it up in the first place. The leather and NAV unit make it a very comfortable ride. I consistently get 40-42 mpg winter, and my last tank was a very representative 47+. I have gotten as high as 51+ mpg, but that was being very careful and does not normally conform to my driving habits.

Regular oil changes (following the computer, NOT the mileage) and tire rotations are all I have had to perform so far. Two weeks ago the service tech asked me how long ago I had the brakes done. He figured with the higher mileage on the odometer, I must have had them done at least once. When I told him that I hadn't had them done yet, he told me that they have better than half the pads left and the rotors look great. The tires are still original with 5/32"" of tread remaining.",
2009,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"Bought new in April 2009.  At 5000 IMA/Check engine light went on; after a lot of doubletalk dealer adjusted computer codes.  This appears to be a problem-see Edmund's forum on the IMA topic.

Gas mileage started in mid-40s, has dropped to mid-30s.  This is a slow, small car; mileage should be better, and clearly not as advertised.

Hoping that mileage gets better and IMA problems don't recur; will keep posted.",
2009,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"This car does not what I expeccted. First you have poor visablity to sides, sets to low to ground, you have to guess where the front end is all the time or damage the front bumper, into the wheel stops in parking lots.  The fuel economy is so so, totaly empty on trip you can stretch it to almost 50 mpg. but with cargo it drops like a rock in the ocean. I averaged loaded down on trip to FL 34 highway. 750 is the max hauling, I had less than that.  Around FL it's doing about 35 mpg, far cry from the sticker. It is not a fund car to drive, the braking, and in traffic is aweful, starting stopping etc.",
2009,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"The 2009 Honda Civic gets slightly freshened exterior styling, a few new features, and some new trim levels. These compact cars come in 4-door sedan and 2-door coupe body styles. Also offered is a gas/electric Hybrid sedan, as well as a sedan that runs on compressed natural gas (CNG). Sedans and coupes come in DX, LX, EX, EX-L, and sporty Si trims. New for 2009 are DX-VP and LX-S sedans. The limited-edition MUGEN Si has been discontinued. DX, DX-VP, LX, LX-S, EX, and EX-L have a 140-hp 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine.",
2009,Honda,Civic Hybrid,I've had my Honda Civic Hybrid one week and on the first two tanks of gas (I put on a lot of miles in my commute here in Southern California)I received 45.8mpg and 47.9mpg respectively.   The car runs on the highway smoothly with no outside noise.  The Nav and audio systems are easy and very nice for this car.   My teens love it as they can connect their IPODS into the audio system.   I bought the car for its high mileage not any Green need of mine.   ******** a hybrid just adds to the good measure of the car.   The engine continuously adjusts between gas and electric and you almost never notice it.  Go for it if you want a real car and one that looks like a real car and not that hideous Prius thing.,
2009,Honda,Civic Hybrid,"I bought the first Honda Civic Hybrid in 2003 over the Toyoya Prius because Honda gave me a better deal and the Toyota sales person (the sales person's ""daddy"" owned the dealership on Long Island) was an obnoxious kid, who would not budge on price. Unfortunately, I went with the Civic.

The Honda Civic is a nice looking car and fairly well built, but as a Hybrid, my 2003 Honda Civic stinks.

I am getting 30mpg, which is WORSE than a regular Civic gets.

I wish Toyota would take this Honda Lemon and give me a 2009 Toyota Prius as a swap. 

Toyota can use this 2003 Civic Hybrid as an example in their television ads on how NOT to build a hybrid.

A good idea for a commercial and publicity for Toyota is you ask me.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Bought new in January 2007. Terrible gas mileage. Never came close to published numbers. Eats tires. Plan to replace every 20-30,000 miles. Took the AWD because it was available, and it sucks. Every 15,000 miles you have to (Are you ready?) change the rear differential fluid. No, I am not kidding. Ride is poor. Noise is high. Wish we had bought a Highlander.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,My father gifted me the vehicle in 2007 and fulfilled my dream of driving a driving a superb SUV. Honda cars are known for their long life engines and stability. I still drive it and I love it all the more.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I like my CR-V very much. However, I have had 3 doorlock problems. The first problem was an inoperatve Right Rear Door Lock replaced free under warranty. the second was an inoperative Left Rear Door Lock which was replaced at a cost of $250.00. The third was an inoperative Drivers Side Door which was replaced at a cost of $350.00. Honda America in CA claims I""m the only to have these problems. I find this hard to believe. Is it true? My CR-V has 41,000 miles to date.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"In a very short amount of time I came to the realization that the car had poor workmanship and a mpg lower than the neighbors Chevy Tahoe.
 Many problems and will go back to GM and keep the money in the US.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Disappointed! Mileage is dismal even though I drive like an old lady, very conservative on the gas pedal. The ride is not very smooth, feels like an economy vehicle and not like the other H SUV I drove and but decided on Honda for the prestige. AC went out at 55K, on my 2nd set of tires, road noise is annoying and really wish I gotten a better equipped one. Too hot in the summer. 
 I am trading it in later this year for the Hyundai Tucson, which gets better mileage (the 2010 that is out now is 31 on freeway but, am waiting for the Blue Edition, with turbo charged engine and even better mileage) and has more horsepower as well as much more refinement and much quieter ride as well as smoother. Honda steering is better but that is all I can say for the CRV. Don't let prestige fool you, I could kick myself in the butt. *wish I had not driven the new Hyundai as I can't wait to get it!
 
 I did like the Subaru and Toy Rav as well and think they also would have been better choices. BMW X3 great engine response but thought the Hyundai nicer interior as well as being bigger.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Paint: Small rust bubbles appearing from underneath the paint on the rear liftgate within three months of purchase.
 
 Resolution: Honda replaced the tailgate and paid for installation and painting at the dealer's recommended body shop.
 
 December 2009: More rust bubbles. Honda says it's not their problem. I'm now spending $400 a month for a car that will likely have significant rust within the next few years.
 
 If you're considering buying a 2009?
 1. be sure to look up premature tire wear on factory tires--TERRIBLE tires--lots of noise, poor performance. My new Bridgestone's made a huge difference in noise and quality of ride.
 2. research problems with the rear differntial--wish I had!--dealer claims maintenance every 15-20K miles is standard--can't find this in the owners manual though!
 3. don't believe the gas mileage--lousy.
 
 Great space, great size and some nice features--just a poor quality vehicle and poor manufacturer support.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought this SUV because my wife wanted it. After 30000 miles I had to buy a new set of tires. The inside door panel always squeeked and the TPS system (tire pressure) always malfunctioned. The service dept. never fixed anything. They always made an excuse that they couldn't find the problem. We barely get 22 MPG and the ride is rough with a lot of wind noise on the front windshield. My Ford Ranger Pickup gets 25 MPG!! I am VERY disappointed with Honda. After all the good things I heard about them I have come to the conclusion they are no better than a VW beetle. Take my advise don't buy one. I paid over $26,000 dollars for a piece of junk. I could have bought two cars for that much money and they probably would have been much better.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Initially, I really loved my CRV. Since buying, I have changed jobs and now drive 3 hours a day round trip. I have found that the drivers seat is not all that comfortable because it just doesn't have the lower back support. Also, there are terrible blind spots on this vehicle. I guess that they realized that because now they have optional cameras for rear views. I have found that the engine noise is a little loud. I get, on average 27 to 29 mpg. I am seriously thinking of trading in for a Honda Fit. I still love Honda, just plan to love it in a smaller way!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,I love my Honda!!I drive an Hour and 1/2 day and I spend only $5 per day on gas..It is so roomy too!The only thing I ******* had would be a closed in consol.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,I love the fog lights on my CR-V. They are of EXcellent quality.GOOD SAFETY FEATURE.I have had no NO warranty problems.If the fog lights are installed at the time of purchase they are covered by the three year warranty.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Both 2007 Honda CRV foglight glass covers broke at about 12000 and 20000 miles respectively When dealer was asked if that was unusual or would be a design flaw (or covered under warranty), he said ""no"". I think otherwise. Clearly a design flaw. When asked how much to repair, it is about $500! Unreal. Why? You have to take the bumper cover off the front end of car. Also, don't drive down the highway with the windows down on a nice day not requiring use of air conditioning. You will hear this tremendous womp womp sound that is deafening. Noise is so loud you cannot hold a conversation inside car. Car obviously designed for wind efficiency assuming windows are always up. Bridgestone radial tires that came with car wore out at about 35,000 miles (tires were rotated every 5K). Glad its a lease--it's gone soon.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought my CRV last October and have had fun with my children spotting more and more of them on the road these days. It's a great family car. I get 23/24 MPG average, mostly driving around town and also waiting in line to drop of my son at school. I've noticed that takes a lot of gas. I love the gas gauge, being able to see how much gas I'm using at any ************* changed the way I drive -- trying to use the breaks as little as possible coming up to stops, etc. 
 I only have one complaint: there is NO place to put a CD or CDs. I solved the problem with a CD-sized basket that goes under the console. The center cup-holder that lets down (why?) is poorly designed. Even folks who buy the base model (me!) deserve a place to put their CDs!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"This is the best vehicle I have owned. It's is great. It looks great, runs great, and holds all of my massage supplies easily. I would recommend it to any one.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I am a bit spoiled, I want luxury, hence me owning a Lexus Hybrid SUV just prior to getting my CRV. Truth is, hands down the CRV is better...better navigation system, (same as acura's), better management of size. I am a DJ and the back holds all my equipment, in the Lexus I had to use my back seat too. I have compared this suv with acura's mdx n rdx, and infiniti's ex n fx and hands down the crv is way bigger in the back. And to boot, the mileage averaged 21.7 on my Lexus, and I am averaging 23.8 on my CRV. It has a good amount of pick up I have all the luxury it offers, however I own a 07 and they upgraded the 08 with duel climate and power seats, 2 things I wish I had. So I may trade up for the 09 when it becomes available. I luv this car, my only pet-peeve...too many of them on the road! When I bought it I stood out, now every 5 suv's I see on the road is a CRV.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I sold my 1997 CRV to a trusted relative to take loving care of my old baby. Bought new 2007 at year end. Was somewhat disappointed in mileage at first, but after a good break-in period I'm now over 7,000 miles, had 1st oil change as recommended by the little yellow wrench, and my mileage has jumped sky high! City/stop and go is in mid 20s and highway using cruise was almost 34! My son and I made a long trip short by checking the mileage based on speed, weather, flat or hilly roads, etc. I have now been following all the gas-saving tips - especially using ""cruise"" whenever possible. YES, it makes a big difference, and lessens the possibility of getting speeding tickets too! LOVE MY CRV and recommend it to anyone. Tall ceiling, leg room in back,gets through snow, almost like a convertible when you open the sun roof.",

Very comfortable to drive and ride in. Perfect for our family of 5! You will not be disappointed with this vehicle.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,This is my 5th and BEST CRV yet! I have pulled the others around the country behind a Motorhome. NEVER had on minutes trouble with any of them. LOVE THIS CRV!!!!!!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I love my 2007 Honda CR-V EX, too, but am worried about its reliability. In the two months I've had it, it was in the shop almost a month while the dealership looked for the origin of a high-pitched whine. They replaced the high-pressure power steering hose and pump, alternator, clutch set,and water pump (on a brand new vehicle!) before replacing the AC compressor assembly. The whine is gone so far, but I've only driven it a few days. Time will tell. (But it IS a pleasure to drive.)",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I got my 2007 CRV in May and so far I have no complaints. I was a little concerned about the horsepower as I like to step on the gas, but it does what I need it to do.

2007,Honda,CR-V,"I recently purchased a CRV EX because a friend of mine got one and I was amazed at the roomy interior, the pep but especially - the gas mileage. So, I purchased one. The styling is so great, the sound system terrific. My only complaint is the AC compressor. When in cruise, if I am going up a small hill, the AC begins to make a high pitched noise for about 15 seconds. Took it to the dealer and they replaced the freon thinking there was an air bubble in the line.Didn't make the noise for two days, now it's making it again. My friend's does the same thing. Ugh",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Off and on, Honda's have always been in our life. The last one being a 2000 CR-V. It was an exciting day shopping for a 2007 CR-V. I opted for the top-of-the-line version. It's two months new and no disappointments. CR-V's are bullet-proof!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Its a great vehicle. first time owning a brand new SUV. My children love the space in the back, very useful even better wwhen the seats are folded for larger cargo. Great horse power for such a small SUV. worth every penny, cant wait 2 see later updated models.Its such a cute vehicle cant help but turn my head when i see someone else driving one. unfortunatelly i have a basic model but well equipped, they are breath taking.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Enjoy driving my crv, but after 10 yrs of a mini van, i do feel its smallness and am conscious of many more blind spots.With aging knees,however, I LOVE the height adjustable seat and appreciate being able to park in tight spaces. The highway gas mileage is great - have gotten 29mpg, but locally with all the newly installed stops signs & traffic lites in our town, I""m only getting 17-19mpg. Definately preferred driving it to the RAV4,tho, and have never found the 4 cyl a problem in any driving situation. If I had it to do again, I think i'd still make the same choice.",

At first glance of the new, 2007 Honda CRV I was in love. Thinking I may not be able to afford the car I went to a dealer to discuss. I walked away that day with a brand new Honda CRV because after consulting with Huntington Honda's helpful and experienced staff I realized they could make my dream come true, and they did. Not only is this car a beauty inside and out, not to mention smooth and peppy, it is affordable too! I love my new car!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"This is my 3rd AWD CRV (2001LX, 2004EX). Its priced better than the Forester and Rav4, and has many included extras compared to the SantaFe. It has alot more HP/torque than previous and much better MPG. Just got back from trip to PA and averaged 28.6. City has been 22.7 avg.",

2007,Honda,CR-V,"We decided to buy a new car because between us, we had over 410,000 miles on our cars. We were really impressed with the Mazda CX-7 and the Nissan Murano, and wanted to test the new Ford Edge. We drove the Mazda, liked it, were just driving to the Nissan dealer when we passed Honda. We decided to take a look, saw the tea green CR-V sitting there, and it was all over for both of us. We fell in love with the new body style, loved the roomy interior and the color was so unusual, we HAD to have this car!! It was on the 4th of July and we were late for a family party, so we made a date to return the following day. We also wanted to stick to our plan of really shopping around for the perfect car, so thought we would just check the others out on our way back to Honda. We went back to Mazda, weren't real impressed with the staff at the dealership, plus I think we were both stuck on Honda. We ended up back at Honda, never drove any of the others we had intended, bought our beautiful CR-V and have never regretted it once!! We have taken this car on road trips, drive it around town, highway, just about everywhere. I love it, it drives so easily, handles well, we get on average 25.7 MPG (I know that because the car tells me so!!)and I love the fact that it lets us know when it's time for servicing. So far we have 6,000 miles and have not needed an oil change!! We thought because it was a 4 cylinder, it would be a little sluggish and not take hills well, but we were wrong!! My husband says it is as much fun to drive as his Mitsubishi Eclipse. For me, there is no comparing it to my old Subaru Outback. This car has been a very welcome addition to our family, and we would buy another if we ever need to. We are really looking seriously at the Civic for a delivery car and a Ridgeline for our next truck purchase. You really can't go wrong with a Honda!!",

I'm just not impressed with anything except the very cool styling. Little annoying issues, such as a low tire light that refuses to go off, creaks and squeeks, and it is just a bumpy boring to drive little car. Not too much fun on the highway, either...it feels light and cheesy.

2007,Honda,CR-V,"Took ownership Sept 24 and on the ride home I was very pleased with the car. Brand new and she averaged about 28 miles to the gallon on the highway. The car is gorgeous. Solid and quiet. Go to a showroom and open and close a door. Sounds just like the RX-350. With the sunroof open and it's quality sound system blaring, road noise is not a problem. The fit and finish look like Lexus quality to me. I purchased the 4WD EX-L with Navi. I will post an update later to let you know how I feel about the car 3-6 months from now. My biggest suprise was how quick she is for a 4-cylinder. I did not even consider the car in the begining of my research because of that reason alone. However after the test drive with the potential for 28-30 MPG and $80 dollar a barrel oil the vehicle was certainly peppy enough for me.

I have driven it across country and found it to be extremely comfortable, as did my passanger. I found no issue with the AC, even in 104 degree heat. The controls for the navigation system and audio system are easy to access. I wouldn't own another car.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I came from a mid size domestic car & haven't found the CR-V anywhere close to as comfortable as my old car. While it is nimble around town, the ride is choppy on the highway. The seats cause me back & hip pains. The A/C barely keeps up with the heat in the South. Friends that have Accords & Ridgelines say, after using it for a couple of days, that they can't believe that it is made by Honda. I've averaged a little over 22 mph in a mix of 60% highway to 40% city driving. The nav system is easy to use but doesn't contain info newer than 18 to 24 months old. I'm trading mine in ASAP.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,I BOUGHT A 2007 CR-V FOR MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER. FIVE WEEKS AND ABOUT 1400 MILES LATER SOMEONE PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF MY DAUGHTER WHILE SHE WAS DOING 45MPH. THE NEW CR-V WAS TOTALED AND MY DAUGHTER THAT WAS DRIVING ESCAPED WITH MINOR SCRATCHES. MY OTHER DAUGHTER THAT WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT HAD BRUSES FROM THE SEAT BELTS AND THAT WAS IT. I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THEY CAME OUT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER CR-V WHEN I GOT THE INSURANCE MONEY. THANKS HONDA FOR A SAFE AND WELL BUILT CAR.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"After driving the good old ""Mommy Van"" for 13 years I was thrilled to see the redesigned CR-V. It is fun to drive and feels really solid. Got a few add on's for my EX-L and couldn't be happier. I've had it for almost a year and have had not the first problem. Thank you Honda!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I've owned the Green Tea 2007 LX CR-V since 09/07. I bought it used with 10,000 miles and I feel so bad for whoever had to give this wonderful car up!! The handling is amazing and my passengers have complimented the smooth ride. One of the BEST PARTS?! Because of the high safety rating, my insurance rates actually dropped (my trade in was a 2000 Mazda 626 with 111,000 miles!) I hope to keep this car for 10 years. It was listed this month in Consumer Reports as a best bet to drive for 200,000 miles if you keep up with recommended maintenance.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,J's CR-V,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought my Honda CR-V on Sept. 5th, 2007.I really love it. It is very roomy, and drives so well. My husband wanted to get away from minivans, so We compromised. Instead of a truck or a car we bought a Honda CR-V! Even he is impressed with it. It is so much more roomier on the interior than it appears on the exterior. I get nothing but conpliments on my SUV. I test drove Ford's Edge, Chevy's Equinox, Nissan's Xterror, Dodge's Durango and a few others, and I wouldn't get anything else!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,After buying my first Honda thinking it would be,
2007,Honda,CR-V,a quality built car I found myself defending it over,
2007,Honda,CR-V,and over again.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,In a very short amount of time I came to the realization that the car had poor workmanship and a mpg lower than the neighbors Chevy Tahoe.(WHICH BY THE WAY RODE AND LOOKED BETTER THAN MY CR-V.),
2007,Honda,CR-V,One example of the many problems I had was if I was to touch the key with my bare hands while trying to retrieve it from my pocket the oil in your skin would mess up some reading devise in the ignition.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,The HONDA Dealer informed me that this was not a problem and that taking 10 mins.to start your car every day was no big deal! NEXT VEHICLE CHEVY TAHOE!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I like my CRV, but it has given me too much problems. I had turned it in about 4 times to be fixed. All four times indicated the stability of the car. Most of the time I drive, it feels I'm going to fall over. This past weekend, I was driving with my family and my daughter asked me why does it feels like the car is pulling us out of the road. Overall I didn't think I would have had this much problem with a brand new car this soon.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased my honda CRv, last July. I love the car but there are 2 major issues. First the passenger side wiper pushes water right into the drivers view making it hard to see, the blade don't cover enough windsheild on drivers side. To me the head lights are too dim or not properly adjusted",
2007,Honda,CR-V,I HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO HONDA CARS FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND AFTER I SOLD MY 1994 ACCORD THAT I BOUGHT NEW AND IS STILL GOING STRONG AFTER 13YRS. OF RELIABLE SERVICE! I HAD JUST PLANNED ON GETTING ANOTHER ACCORD UNTIL I TOOK A LOOK AT THE CR-V'S I REALLY LIKED THE WAY IT LOOKED AND AFTER A TEST DRIVE I WAS HOOKED!!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I DROVE IT OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP ON AUG.5,2007 AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH FUN DRIVING IT!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,I HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD HANDLE AROUND CORNERS ON WINDING ROADS AND BEING ALITTLE TOP HEAVY BUT I HAVE BEEN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!! IT IS PRETTY AGILE AND MORE RESPONSIVE THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,I BOUGHT THE BASIC FRONT WHEEL DRIVE LX MODEL AND WAS HAPPY WITH HOW WELL EQIPPED IT CAME. I DO NOT NEED ALOT OF EXTRA AMENITIES THAT I WOULD NOT USE BUT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ALOT OF EXTRAS HONDA CAN MORE THAN ACCOMMODATE YOU THE CR-V'S HAVE ALOT OF FUN AND PRACTICLE ITEMS AVAILABLE.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MID SIZED SUV IT HAS EVERYTHING AND MORE I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT MY DECISION TO GET THE CR-V PLUS I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT!! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DRIVING THIS HONDA FOR AS LONG AS I DROVE MY ACCORD 13YRS. I HAVE NEVER REGRETED BUYING A HONDA THEIR RELIABILITY IS SUPERIOR!! IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE CR-V YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"This is my 2nd Honda and it probably will not be my last. In August of 2007 I traded in my 2002 Accord, that I purchased brand new for the new 2007 CRV. I thought I would regret trading in my ""no"" car payment car in for a car payment. I have no regrets at all! I absolutely love my CRV!! It is very stylish, comfortable, modern and the lights on the gages are probably my favorite feature. It rides very well and smooth. My husband and I used to fuss about who was going to drive because neither of us wanted to, now we fuss over who gets to drive! It is a great value! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great little suv!!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought the 07 CRV EX-L Sept 06, the week Honda released the new body style. Unfortunately, I had to pay full sticker price due to supply and demand. I bought it for my college freshman daughter who was driving an 06 VW Beetle Convertible. What a difference! It is so roomy she can bring everything home. All her friends want to go in her vehicle because it is so roomy and has 4 doors. I have an 06 Pilot and cannot decide which I like better. The city gas mileage is a little disappointing but highway is good. We prefer the climate controlled air conditioning in the Pilot and wish it had the same as well as wishing it had an electric driver's seat. I guess you cannot get everything. We are a Honda family with an 04 2dr EX-UVL Accord, an 06 Pilot and and 07 CRV. Now to get my husband to give up the old trusty Chevy pickup with over 200,000 miles. HONDA's NEVER COST ME ANYTHING ON MAINTENANCE! Their dependability and resale makes me know I will always drive a Honda. If you are considering the CRV you will not be making a mistake.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought this car for my wife, and we both love it, it is a far cry from the jeep Liberty she had before!!,It is very roomy considering it's small size. The build quality is top shelf. I highly recommend this little crossover.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Bought my CRV 2 weeks ago. Better than I expected. For the price you get alot of vehicle. I have an EX-L. There are virtually no options to add to the vehicle. Plenty of power. Everything is in the right place. The interior is very nicely finished. No cutting corners. My only complaint would be the seats. A little more cushion would be nice with also thicker armrests. My wife's Murano is $8,000 more with only minor additions compared to my CRV. Mileage is super. I am getting 26 mpg around town. Handling is responsive and very agile. Want a great SUV get the CRV. This is not a commercial. Buy one.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I HAVE OWNED ABOUT 10 DIFFERENT HONDAS IN MY LIFETIME. THIS CR-V IS ABSOUTELY BEYOND A DOUBT THE BEST CAR IVE EVER PURCHASED !! BESIDES ALL THE GREAT HONDA AMENITIES THAT IM USED TO HAVING, THE INTERIOR LEG, HIP AND HEAD ROOM ARE SUPERIOR OVER OTHER VEHICLES IN ITS CLASS. IM A LARGE PERSON AND ALWAYS HAVE HAD A ISSUE WITH FEELING IM ""STUFFED"" IN A CAR. THE SEATBELT IS VERY LONG AND MORE THAN ENOUGH ROOM TO BUCLE UP. I CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CAR, AND IM ALWAYS BRAGGING TO MY FRIENDS !!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,I purchased the 2007 CRV in April of 07. It was love at first site. I considered the Rav 4 but it didn't hold a candle to the CRV. I traded in my 1993 Honda Civic which I had since it was new. This is my first SUV obviously and I can't say enough about it. I smile every time I look at her :),
2007,Honda,CR-V,I have the Biege metallic and I get compliments on this car every day. I couldn't be happier. I do have to agree with the other reviewer about the blind spot on the right side but I have gotten used to it. I love Hondas !!!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"We bought the CRV-EXL after owning 2 Accord V-6. I have always enjoyed driving my Hondas, the CRV even more so. I have never driven a SUV before, test drove the CRV in 2000 before buying my second Accord and it handled too much like a truck for me. The 2007 drives like a luxury car and I love the look with the rear spoiler. I am a small woman and it is very easy to get into and out of this SUV. I do miss the convenience of having the automatic temperature control and electric adjustable front seats features that were in the Accord. Those features would make the CRV perfect!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I have been meaning to leave feedback for awhile now. Especially since I have used it to help determine the SUV that I purchased. It was a great decision to buy the CRV. Safe, reliable, pick up is great. Plenty of room too. We recently moved and were pleasantly surprised at how much we could pack into the CRV. I constantly get compliments about it from other people. Great buy!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,This is the 3rd Honda that have owned; last one was a 90 Accord. I purcashed via the internet from an out of town dealer and got a discoount that I couldn't get visiting another local dealer. The dealer was more than fair and the owner of Classic Honda actually greeted us at the dealership and gave us tickets to an Indians game. Can't beat that. What a businessman.,
2007,Honda,CR-V,This car is fantastic. I love the gas milage the comfort and the space. I am a BBW and the car works well with my body style while giving me better gas milage and lots of hidden space to carry all of my things!!!!!!,
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased a 1999 CRV new and really just got tired of the car. I bought a 2007 CRV EX last November and love the upgrades-the leather, heated side mirrors, the XM radio, the rear shelf to hide what is in the trunk. The only thing I wish Honda would improve on is a thermostat to regulate the temperature like in the Odyssey",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought this car specifically to tow behind my RV, as discussed on page 250 of the owner's manual. For an extended tow, you are instructed to remove Fuse 34, so you don't drain the battery. I am 57 years old, and had to get under the steering wheel, on my back, with a flashlight in one hand and a pair of needlenose pliers in the other hand - to both get and replace fuse. The fuse is one of the micromini fuses. And don't drop the fuse, because it falls back into the wires. You have put Fuse 34 in a absolutely impossible location! And, Auburn Honda won't even discuss a solution for the problem, so I won't be going back to them. Any way of putting Fuse 34 in the fuse box under the hood? Any suggestions? I'm now going to get my car serviced by Autowest Honda in Roseville, CA. I must get this shortcoming fixed - otherwise, I like the car. Please advise.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Fantastic great mileage, secure feeling ride, multiple compliments from admirers,good insurance rates absolute pleasure and priviledge to drive. lots of pep in this LX.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"All I can say is I love, love, love this car!!! Not one complaint!!!!!!!!!!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"We just bought a CR-V EXL in June. It came with all the options in the MSRP price ticket. The SUV is loaded, rides great, and has plenty of room for four. We just completed a trip through the mountains of TN, W VA, and southern Ohio. The D3 feature gave the car the boost we needed to go up the mountain roads. We absolutely love the car and the price we paid for a Honda backed vehicle.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Got our CR-V December 2006--our first AWD vehicle. Worth its weight in gold in Upstate NY winter snow! Love the styling and all the features for the price. Great ride, excellent handling, smooth transmission, peppy engine, quiet even with sunroof open. Averaging 26mpg--have reached 30 on the highway! Comfortable seats, versatile interior, roomy back seat. No complaints!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I owned 2 Rav-4's - though the Rav rides a little more solid - the CRV far out does the Rav in room, performance and style. This is my 2nd CRV and it would take a lot to make me change.(I do miss the hatch window & the table though).",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"This is the whole package! After test-driving all the competition and comparing prices it was an obvious choice for me. The new design is amazing, its 4 cylinder drives like a 6 (even with air on and back loaded with boxes). Honda dealership was most impressive and honest. The Cr-v is an excellent vehicle and seems like a bargain even at sticker.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"After having a company car for seven years, it was time to buy my own. I had a lot of friends tell me how good CR-Vs were. They were right!! I love my new car and the AWD in Minnesota winters will come in handy!!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"huge change from sporty coupe---but very palateable! in 2 months, put on 6000 mi---this vehicle ROCKS & is a delight to drive/own! dealership made this a very special experience--getting used to driving her was fun but...also easy as it was love at first sight!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"This is an exceptionally attractive vehicle with a zippy four cyl that I've had at 120 with no effort. The gas mileage is great, the quality of the vehicle is superior. When you stop to buy gas thats when you really put a smile on your face. Love the gas mileage and the dash board lighting is awesome.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"Can't say enough about my CRV. I was absolutely positive that I would trade an '01 Camry for an '07 until I test drove the CRV. It's the first SUV for me and for once I've been able to buy a piece of furniture and not have to pay for delivery because it fit nicely in the back of my CRV. The side body molding and the rear spoiler make it look finished. I love that the gear shift is not between the front seats. There's a roomy console instead and a great little storage space above the glove box. I'm even looking forward to winter to try out my heated front seats. It is fun to drive and the safety features are impressive. The people at Dick Brooks Honda in Greer, S.C. were excellent and I plan to do business with them in the future.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"The CRV is great handling, comfort and style, but when Honda made it more aerodynamic, they cut back the size of the rear back side windows. Bad right side blind spot. Can not make fast lane changes on the highway to avoid the blind spot. Compared it to the Toyota RAV, which I found stiff handling, broken sun-roof and confusing instrument panel.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"REALLY CRaVe the CRV....ANNE living in MD, moving to NH bought the CRV in NH. AWD was only choice for NH.",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"It rides smoothly like as luxury vehicle. Handles well on the road...hugs the road in all types of weather. Roomy, too! Highly recommend this vehicle!",
2007,Honda,CR-V,"I bought my crv exl back in january 2007.I went from a new 07 eddie baugher expedition, total luxuary, to aford escape for fuel savings that I hated.Then to my crv that I love.I love it more than my expedition as far as luxuary.The ride and confort compair great.The fuel is wonderful.town driving worst case 17mpg and highway at 27 to 28mpg.The only problem i have found is it has a pull to the right most often.sometimes to the left.When i took it back i was told it was a natuarle pull. Later I found out there is no such thing. Honda has now become aware of this. Theyhave posted a bullitun about it. I am going back today to see what they are going to do. Now working at a repair shop I have found out that when you take it in to ask for the spects before they put it on the alignment machine and the spects after. You should also be given a copy of the alignment report. However,without the fuel consideration,I would still take this over my expedition.It is a wonderfull suv to own. Thanks HONDA, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.",

2007,Honda,CR-V,Love the style. So many people come up and say what kind of a vechicle is that. gas millage is around 27 better than that if highway driven. we did not get the awd because of gas millage. It is quite peppy and love the handling. only thing i would have done different is get the back up pkg hard to see backing up.and the middle consel between fron seats. we did look at toyota but there sales people were indifferent and didnt seem like they really wanted to be bothered. we traded in a chevy trailblazer and we were only getting 17 mile on that so this is quite nice,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased this vehicle new in January 2009 and loved it! I read the reviews about the cheap plastic and how easily it scratches...it does. I saw a review about the passenger seat cloth wearing...it is. I'm on my third set of tires. I have nearly 80,000 miles on my car. The majority of them are highway miles. I have faithfully maintained the car and done all of the recommended service. I have never had a bit of mechanical trouble with it until this year. Since January 2011, I have had to have the rotors machined, the VTEC spool valve failed as I was traveling on the highway last week (had to tow it to the nearest dealer) and now... the A/C conpressor has gone bad. I am NOT happy that I seem to have reached a magical mileage number where stuff is starting to go bad. This is my first Honda after two Toyota's. They lasted me over 200k miles each and were still going when I desired a new car. I still like the vehicle and might even consider buying another one, but my trust level to take it on my travels has plummeted. Hoping Honda will do the right thing with the A/C compressor, especially since I hear this is not an uncommon problem.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I have a 2008 CR-V EX all wheel drive. I was impressed with it at first, until the tires wore out at 17,000 miles(quality ???). The 17"" rims made buying new tires very expensive, over $600. That was just for snow tires. Another $600 plus for all season tires. 
  Then at 19,000 miles it needed the rear brakes(quality again ????)... Another $300. What will be next?? I just added $1500 to a year and a half vehicle. Not a happy camper..
 I thought Honda was a quality company. 
 In the past, I owned Toyota Camrys and never had these problems. In fact one Camry had 90,000 miles and never a brake job. 
 I just hope these cost cease or I will be going back to Toyota.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"We bought our first Honda in 1976. We have really enjoyed the five we have owned, great quality, fun to drive. The CRV has the quality and all-wheel drive is much more sure footed in snow compared to the Accords we have owned previously. We are disappointed in the ride, it is just too stiff and bouncy even when compared to other and larger suv's we have driven. I would not buy another one. Also noticed the front seat passengers seat upholstery is wearing quickly.Thought it might be us but peaking in other CRV windows I notice wear in the same spot as ours.Take a long test drive before buying one. Over the years Honda has lost a lot of the edge it had over competitors as they have caught up.Also not the quietest vehicle although better than they used to be. Around town milage is 22mph,on the road, about 25-26. Had tires filled with Nitrogen which did not improve milage but did stop slow air leaks in all the tires especially in cold weather.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"After buying a 2007 CRV EX AWD, trading it in for a 2008 Altima and then getting a 2008 CRV EX AWD I now have the car that I really love. I think my 1st CRV had something wrong with it because I couldn't get over 17 mpg (took it back to the dealership 3 times) and it just didn't feel right no matter what I did so traded in (2200 mi.) for the Altima (better gas mileage but no ESC or traction control and that made me nervous) so I the 2008 CRV EX AWD and couldn't be happier. I love the way it handles and all the safety features and I'm getting 20 mpg in the city and when I've taken it on the highway driving 60-7 mph I get 30-31 mpg. I haven't taken it on a trip yet, but am anxious to see what I'll get on I-95 for a few hours. My only complaint is not having the larger center console to store my cd's or other things that I want close by. I did get the remote starter installed aftermarket and it's really great especially since I like to take my 13 yo)Jack Russell for rides and if I have to run in a store for a few minutes I don't have to worry about her getting heat exhaustion in the summer or being too cold in winter.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I have been driving euro cars for the past 20 years(audi,mb,bmw,am). I borrowed my sister-in-law's car(odyssey), and was amazed how it drives-making me think about a CRV. I have had the car for 3 months and absolutly love it. It never occured to look into the japanese market since I have to admit I was a snob for euro driving. I am having so much fun with my 4 cylinder car vs 8 cyl....I am thrill with my ride ! I ended getting my car via online asking for 10 ""out-the-door"" quotes paid $24,185.00 and that's it for an EX (fwd). The radio is great, car is roomy, ride is quite and light. We got 30mpg@70mph on the hwy, and 20mpg@90mph on the same trip. Controls are easy. The only thing I can critize is that it only has only lighter to charge the phone , ipod, would be nice to have 2. The lock control I am still getting use to. Highly recomended...love it",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I have always had a Ford F150 Quad cab. I loved them until I bought the CR-V. Great gas mileage, and its great on gas, I drive it easy and get an average 25-26 mpg.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,I really like everything about the CR-V. I am getting over 29 mpg overall. Rides great and there is ample room for five people. I like the way the rear seats fold down giving you extra space for cargo. My only suggestion is to make the arm rests adjustable so when you tilt the seat back the arm rest stays level. Minor problem. I test drove a Toyota RAV-4 and the CR-V won hands down. The CR-V is a much better car.,

 My friend has the 2007 Honda CR-V. I haved a GMC Envoy and a Jeep Liberty. I can assure the CR-V is 
 no Jimmie or Jeep. The Honda is junk compared to my Jimmie or Jeep. My friend says it's his first and last Honda. His CR-V is in the shop at best every other month. he has had major electrical problems and Brakes went bad at 70000 not covered by warranty. Big bucks to fix at Honda $800+. Struts leak. Can't keep it aligned. I just have to do the regular maint. Oil, tire rotate and etc. I know cars well. I going to look at Jeep Patriot and the New Chevy CUV next year as it will be time to trade because of mileage",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"A long time buyer of Hondas since 1981. All others were Civics in the begining, then Accords 1996, 2000.
  This is my first CRV and I absolutely love it. Our middle daughter has a 2007 CRV EX and she was also saying she was only getting 19-20 in town around Atlanta.I have had my 2008 three months now. Depending on how I drive (Key words)I have gotten 25-27 mixed driving and on strictley highway with 4 adults and 5 yr old Grandaughter we got 32.3. I drove our Daughters 2007 strictly highway and had 32.1. It's all about your driving habits, period!
  I suggest and I'll report back when I am switching to Synthetic motor oil and will keep 33 psi in the tires rather than the recommend 30psi. I have used synthetic after the first 3000-3500 miles on past Accords with excellent results. My last 2000 Accord I kept 8 years before buyng this CRV. Great Quality.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Oh my goodness, this is such a great little vehicle! We picked ours up in August, having had to wait a month and a half for it to arrive to the dealer. I went from an '05 Grand Prix to the CR-V, and there really is no comparison. The CR-V rides smoothly, very little highway noise, and I generally get between 26-28 m.p.g. just tooling around the area. Highway driving gets me 30-32 m.p.g. I love the rear door that opens up, rather than out, and the cargo shelf is so very handy....pretty much doubles your shopping storage space. The only thing I don't like about this vehicle is that the doors do not automatically unlock when you turn the vehicle off. It is a pain to have to hit unlock to let all your passengers out, and yeah, the armrests are a little too little, but in the grand scheme of things, I think it's pretty good if that is all I have to complain about. When my husband and I went to look at the CR-V at the dealer to test drive it, we had to wait 20 minutes just to speak to a salesman...yes, that is how busy the Honda dealer was! They only had one CR-V left on the lot, which we drove and immediately knew we wanted one. There were others waiting in line to test drive, what a zoo! Fortunately, the dealer had a vehicle on order that was exactly what we wanted, so we put a deposit on it, and waited 7 weeks for it to come. It was well worth the wait, I wouldn't trade my little Crave for anything. Well, anything but a Shelby Mustang....",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Got mine in January 08. Replacing a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee and an 04 Volvo S60 -- two in one. Not quite luxury but not shabby either. Nimble, yet will haul large objects. Only complaints are the flimsy, ill-placed armrests and the mileage, which has never reached 25 mph average even on pure highway driving. The Volvo got 34 hwy, the Jeep only 19. Overall, brilliant design. Safe, too, says NHTSA. Plan to drive it for a decade or more, if the usual Honda reliability is there. Runs on regular and maintenance is a fraction of my previous cars. With the CR-V one person no longer needs two cars. Hooray for Honda.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"We have owned Accords since '92, ready for a change, great choice 2008 CRV EX,bought in June, good looking, drives great,comfortable,side air bags, good mileage (live in urban area a few miles from large city and usually get 24/26 mpg. 
 
 The trick to getting good mileage escapes many and they drive like 16 year olds. Start off a little slower, anticipate red lights, no quick starts or stops, yea, like an egg under your foot. 
 
  THINGS I REALLY LIKE: sounds small, but i like that the door locks when i get in and opens when i shift to Park, like back dark windows, smooth ride,bigger tires,alarm system finally place for my purse, plenty of get-up-and go, (didn't expect this)moon roof. 
 
 Buying EX instead of LX is worth the extra money, but EX to EXL isn't. only bought 2 accessories, full trunk rubber mat $100 and wheel locks $55. They gave me the touch up paint and free oil changes.
 
 Dealerships, with internet sales, are the way to go: better price, and you still go in to finish sale. less haggling.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I got me CRV- EX L W/Navi aprox 5 months ago & I can't say enough about the car, I did compare it with the Rav-4 & a few other options but in the end, I fell in love with my CR-V, I had it pimped out a bit (all black, with chrome pillars & black/chrome rims) I get tons of complements on it, the only thing I would say stinks is that There is no Bluetooth options & there is a aux jack for universal imputs, but I would have liked to have my ipod controlled threw the sterio controls... Ohhh well, hopefully soon. Oh yea & it's a little loud when driving on highways (interior noise)",
2008,Honda,CR-V,I've had my 2008 crv awd ex about one month and I do love it so far. I do have one area that I feel Honda should look at. When driving at normal highway speed the transmition drop out of overdrive with the slightest amount of the gas peddle applied. I feel that the program that controls this area could be changed to delay this shifting and would improve the gas mileage. The engine has enough power.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I love my CR-V! I traded in my 99 Prelude which was great, but I had to use premium gas, and it had horrible gas mileage. It was also awful in snow. I'm hoping the CR-V gas mileage improves. I'm getting about 18 MPG, ******** all city driving. That is still better than my old car, and it's regular gas, so I can't complain. Otherwise the CR-V is great. The interior and exterior are beautiful, and it has a nice ride. There are so many nice features, and it looks as if it is a lot more expensive than it is. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this car to anyone!",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Bought my 2008 CR-V EX 9 mos. ago after driving a 2004 CR-V for 4 yrs. Love both of them. I get 22-24 mpg around town and 27-29 mpg on trips and that's with speeds on interstates of 80-90 mph w/ a/c. Has plenty of power and has even seen 100 mph which I don't recommend. Has the ride and drive of a car but sits up higher but is easy to get in and out of. Lay the back seats down and you can pack it full. The larger 17"" tires gives it a better ride and a tighter feel on the road. Not interested in ever going back to a regular car.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,I'm not sure how these people are getting only 22 or 23 mpg on the highway . I can get that driving in town. We love our CR-V. It drives great and we have been getting about 21 mpg in town and anywhere from 31 to 34 on the highway. That is running the a/c and driving 70 on the interstate. If you are in the market for a car the CR-V is worth a test drive.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Traded in my MUSTANG, so the power is missing, but the ease of the drive is wonderful. Love this small but big feeling SUV. The only complaint I have so far is the gas mileage I was surpised to see that it gets 20 local and about 23 24 highway, other than that, love this car.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Purchased 2008 CRV-EX-L 2 months ago. I would still be driving my wonderful 1999 Jeep with 110,000+ miles if red-light runner had not totaled my Jeep--also totaled his 2008 Nissan. So far, I'm pleased with new car. Only complaint is armrests--too small and I'm not a large lady (husband also complains). After adjusting steering wheel/seat position, I'm able to get more comfortable but not great. I have been driving Jeeps for many, many years so it will take awhile to get use to this car. Haven't tried 4WD yet--don't want to take to beach until it is broken in. Did take husband's Jeep to Ocracoke, NC, last week and didn't see one Honda CRV driving on the beach. I hope this is not telling me something. Did see lots of Jeeps!!!! I do plan on having this Honda for many years and hope I will not be sorry I didn't purchase another Jeep. Yes, gas mileage on Honda is better than Jeep but as my car friend told me--""Buy the car you love and putting gas in will not hurt as much."" Buying the new Honda was a very easy process. We had done our homework and knew what to pay. My husband worked for Chrysler for over 35 yrs so he was very familiar with how the process goes. Friends can't believe we have a Honda in our driveway and not a Chrysler. Times are changing!!!",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased a 2008 CRV EX-L in April after a not-so-nice guy driving a huge pickup truck totaled my Toyota Solara and almost killed me. I love being up higher and feel like I have more control over my vehicle. Love the side curtain airbags and all the options! The leather interior is fabulous and the vehicle, to be so small, is VERY roomy! After driving and loving this little SUV, I won't ever go back to driving a sports car (which I had driven for 18 years)! The gas mileage around town is good - about 19-20 MPG, if I drove slower I'm sure it would get better, but for highway driving it's fabulous (about 28 MPG)! I LOVE MY CR-V!",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I LOVE my new CRV everything is so much better than I expected. The air conditioning is fantastic. Not many reviews mention how quickly the air cools the interior. Comfort is awesome, you can not hear the outside world, and there is so much more room inside than ever expected from what appears to be a small car. The Honda CRV puts my old mini-van to shame. 5 Star safety rating, comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin, great handling, excellent gas millage what more could I want?",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"My husband & I purchased our 2008 CR-V EX 2WD in Mar 2008. So far we are VERY happy with it. My DH is a large guy (6' and broad shoulders)and he feels comfortable in this vehicle while it does not feel too big for me... good compromise there. He wanted pep and I wanted good gas mileage, again a good compromise. Our gas mileage around town is probably 26+ mpg & on the last long trip about 30 mpg. We have the 2WD model so this does make as slight difference. We live in a piedmont area with gentle hills. 
  We also considered the Toyota RAV 4 but honestly felt the front interior in the CR-V felt roomier especially for the DH who needs the leg room. There were features of the RAV 4 we preferred(how the back seats go down and lay flatter and the flatter seat bottoms of the front seats) but overall we couldn't be happier with our purchase of our CR-V. We know it will serve us well for years and years.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased 2008 CRV-EX L. Wonderful car! Small SUV for anyone looking for fuel saving car. I get 27-28 MPG highway and around town. (better than I am hearing) Interior back seats recline-good leg room too-spacious. Exterior finish could be better. I recommend getting the extra finish when purchasing/leasing. A little noisy with road noise than usual, BUT I am not complaining.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Only thing I wish is it had a bit more pick up like my Accord did. It's great on gas though and roomy. You don't get that car ride, it's little bumpy on the side streets but great on the highway. I'm thrilled with the safety rating also.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,We just purchased a 2008 honda crv and it is a wonderful car. It has great interior features as well as the exterior look We are thrilled with ours We would give it a 10,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Very happy with my CR-V great options, handles well, good looking, But I do agree it would be better if it got in the 30 miles mpg",
2008,Honda,CR-V,Traded in a honda Accord. Needed the extra height for ease of entry. Gas milage could be better. Seats are comfortable though.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,........for similar reasins below. Gas mileage is terrible and V-4 just doesn't cut it. Like it very much though and will keep it for a while.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Like my CR-V but gas mileage sucks---I get 20 mpg 
 on trips-highway maybe 22-23. Other than that its super",
2008,Honda,CR-V,Just needs a hybrid option to make this the best vehicle on the road,
2008,Honda,CR-V,Drives like a dream. Great interior. LOVE this vehicle.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,Great all around small SUV. In need of a V-6. Merging onto highways is scary.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I justed leased a 2008 CRV-EX 4WD. If you are looking for a smaller SUV with good fuel economy, this is a must to test drive. It has tight handling, decent power (4 cylinder) and a very roomy interior for its size. Everything about the engineering seems just right.... check one out before you buy/lease anything else.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I replaced my 2004 CR-V AWD EX with the 2008 model, it rides & handles better then the 2004 version.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,Great vehicle for running around. It gets the job done. I do mostly city driving & the mileage has been around 19+ MPG. Haven't taken it on a long road trip yet.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,I'm disapointed that a center console wasn't avaiable in the EX model. There is reduced storage space w/o a center console. That's about my only complaint. Haven't had any problems so far.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,Would I buy a CRV again? YES,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"I purchased the top of the line CRV last year instead of the Mazda CX-7 or my first choice: the brown/bronze Honda Element SC (which for reasons totally unknown is not available with the standard all wheel drive system........very bad idea since it rains/snows nationwide)--best looking Element ever!! As a frame of reference, I had previously driven a 2003 VW GTI (loved the handling/low end torque) The new CRV is a vast improvement over the previous model. Acceptable performance once I got used to the handling characterisitics. However, it could be even better:",
2008,Honda,CR-V,1. Increase the low-end torque of the 165HP engine,
2008,Honda,CR-V,2. Stiffen the suspension all around for greater handling at speeed.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,3. Reduce the amount of overall excess chrome considerably; not needed.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,4. Add wider all weather tires to aid/enhance a greater handling capacity,
2008,Honda,CR-V,5. Thicker steering wheel,
2008,Honda,CR-V,6. dual exhaust system to enhance torque,
2008,Honda,CR-V,7. Add additional holes to the rear hatch to secure American license plates--this is currently a problem (clicky clack!!),
2008,Honda,CR-V,8. Add a power driver's seat for greater comfort/flexiblity when adjusting.,
2008,Honda,CR-V,9. Collaborate with Honda's after market arm to create a more aggressive limited edition version because it will sell--the CRV turns heads now to some extent; why not make it sexy :-)!! I've seen it on a website.........yummy!!,
2008,Honda,CR-V,"Hoepfully, Honda USA/Japanese parent company is reading this.",
2008,Honda,CR-V,Thanks for yor consideration--have a great day!,
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I have driven Hondas my whole life and that is all I will ever drive! They ALWAYS last forever and Ive never had an issues with any of them, no matter how old they are! I have also never had a problem trading any of them in and they ALWAYS hold their value! I have also been in several accidents and everytime have been shocked to find hardly any damage on it! Honda's are a safe and reliable car and on top of that they save me THOUSANDS in gas money and they're fun! I now am driving a 2009 CRV and am OBSESSED with it!! It is so comfortable and I have gotten hundreds of compliments on how beautiful it is! There have been several times that I have walked out to the parking lot and mistaken a BMX X5 or Lexus for my car! They look exactly the same! Honda really out did themselves on this one! So long story short, if you're looking for a new car DEFINATLY look into the CRV! I promise you will not be disapointed!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I've had SUV'S now for 20 yrs and last year, because of the gas spike, I traded for a Honda Accord...Beautiful car, but was not good in the snow...I kept checking out the Honda CRV's and finally traded last week...THis car is ME! Love it even more than my Toyota Highlander, which was a 6 cylinder engine...I was apprehensive at first, because it was a 4cyl,  but I see very little difference between the Highlander and my CRV...This car is a keeper, especially with the long New England winters...I really feel safe too, which was one of the determing factors, other than 4 wheel drive...Ok, maybe a nicer rearview mirror and a pop up trunk switch, a bigger fuel tank, but, hey, I'm not complaining!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I've leased through Honda for over 12 years.  Passports and Accords.  Now I have the best of both types of vehicles!  I've decided that this little blue CR-V will be the last one to lease. After the lease ends, I'm keeping it!  Having four kids, needing 4wd, and wanting extra room to haul antiques and gardening supplies...this vehicle has everything I'm looking for!  Plus, it's cute.",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I have been searching for a small SUV for some years now and was actually seriously looking at a Ford Escape, then when the CR-V style changed in 2007, I fell in love and purchased the EX-L in Dec 08 and have been loving it ever since!  There are a few minor setbacks such as the instrument panel where you need to press the little stick to change the settings for the gauges and lack of visor mirror lights but overall for the money this car is definitely an A+!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"Just bought my car and love it !!  I loved my 2002 Ford Focus with 110K miles, but it was time for a change, so I traded it in, got a great discount and drove off in my new CR-V.  I will have this car for a long, long time and I can't wait to drive it across country to see my grandkids in Ohio this summer !!  Plenty of room for all of us !!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"When the salesman said it was a 4 cylinder SUV I said ""NO"" and then the test drive changed everything. The same 0-60 as a Jeep Liberty?
with over an inch higher ground clearance?
I had just test drove the jeep and wanted a safe reliable vehicle. I bought the EXL with all the bells and whistles but what impressed me was the torque response of the engin and seamless acceleration.very little not to like about this car. Id buy another 1.",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"Own an 03'Odyssey and just traded my M-B AMG65 Black Series for a '09 CRV LX. What a difference. The CRV is quicker to load up with 8 bushels of apples, 2 kids and 1 golden retriever AND gets better gas mileage. It is also much quieter around the city. Top quality build mirrors the hand-built AMG. Go Honda",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I had been looking for a smaller car with better fuel economy (I drove a Ford Expedition).  After looking at several crossover type vehicles, my husband and I decided on the Honda EX-L.  I love the quiet ride, peppy engine and all the interior bells and whistles.  It is roomy and my husband who is 6'3"" fits in with room to spare.  So far I've had the car only one month, but I sure do love it!!!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I just purchased the Honda CRV EX after wrecking a Lexus RX.  The ride is ok.  It is a good quality car.  The cloth interior is plain- I hope it lasts as long as the car.  The noise level is somewhat high.  Overall, it is an adjustment.  I like the body style; the gas milage.  I am happy.  I would recommend to anyone.",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"My husband drives this and loves it.  I don't.  I call it the ""bumpmobile"" because of the hard ride. I don't find the passenger front seat comfortable. I will stick with my Toyota Camry. We also had a 4-wheel drive Subaru which was much more comfortable, but not all that reliable. Comfort means a lot to me because of a bad back.",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I just purchased my new CR-V EX-L and I love it. It handles so well and the car is low to the ground, so the body roll is little to none. It's like a car, but larger. The leather is high quality and the dash board is perfectly designed. You fingers don't have a problem finding what it needs. The space inside is perfect. This car maybe one of the best cars ever designed. Heated seats, heated side mirrors, Satellite radio.... This car feels richer than it actually is!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"I finally got the 2009 Honda CRV EX. I looked at alot of vehicles in this category and came back to this one.  I wasnt impressed with the interior of the car. It doesnt have fancy gadgets, over all it needs a little humph, but what it lacks in that department it makes up for having well built engine. I love the fact that doesnt drive like a truck. noise level is so so but overall great. Honda must be doing something right because this dealership was busy. Oh and if you want to get accessories for this car or any other dont go thru dealer, you can find it cheaper online.",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"Hi! My wife and I deided on a 4 wheel drive vehicle out of necessity, due to our relocation to northeast Pennsylvania and the related snowy weather conditions. After previously owning a 2002 & 2006 Honda Accord EX-L V6, I was very apprehensive to downsize to a 4 cylinder engine. We did consider the Honda Pilot having a V6; however, the vehicle was too large for our needs. Hence, we opted for the CR-V with my apprehension as to the 4 cylinder engine. We were pleasantly surprised with the roominess, perforemance and ride of the CR-V - - the 4 cylinder engine is more than adequate and the vehicle performs very well and has enough power when traveling both the highways and interstates. We also considered the RAV 4 with a 6 cylinder engine; however, the suspension was that of a harder ""truck like"" ride, the 6 cylinder engine didn't provide that much additional power and the interior quality did not come up to nor equal the CR-V. We are very pleased with the performance of the CR-V - - the only minor things missing are lighted vanity mirrors and an internal garage door opened. I would recommend the CR-V very highly to anyone desiring a 4 wheel drive vehicle with priorities of both safety and perfomance in addition to style and quality. It is certainly a GREAT VEHICLE!",
2009,Honda,CR-V,"Hi There: I just purchase a Honda CRV EX-l 2 WD, and I am very pleased. I drive average and in a busy cmmunity.  I haven't gone on the highway as far as Interstate is concerned but I did test drive it and fell in love with it.  I test drove a Nissian Murano and a Cadilla SRX and they made call them luxury crossovers or SUV, but the Honda CRV Ex-L either 2WD  or 4WD can stand up to them, and it is very afforable.  It has many of the features they have. I have a 2009 and I love it. The navigation system is great, PC and Mp3 ready, 6CD player and the XM radio is awesome and the sound is as good as Bose as far as I am concern.  Affortable,leather seats, front seats heated, mirror heated, spacious and the back seat can be let down for more room. Dual Temp control! Yes! I love my 2009 Honda CRV EX L 2 WD. Thanks Honda!  I have a 1988 Honda Accord, still running great, 126000 miles and it's a 1988.  Honda keep up the good work and you could very well, gain more than you could ever believe.I love the backup screen, it has many features the other Crossover has, at a much better price. Again, Thank you Honda. Carolyn.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I purchased the 2007 Fit Sport. The window sticker said 38 mpg. I got 38 once. Since then I have logged (I do keep a mileage/fuel log) 40 to 47 mpg. I drive 5 over the limit usually. It has plenty of spunk even at this altitude.(6000 to 8700)I drive from Cripple Creek to Colorado Springs daily. The handling is crisp. It rides like a small car, because it is. It has a lot of storage, especially with the flat fold down seats. I drove it to Cochran, Georgia and back. I was comfortable at the end of each days drive. I installed an XM radio and some really great (on ice)Toyo Observ tires. What a great little commuter car!",
2007,Honda,Fit,Was one of the first to own this car (2006) and it is now two years old and still everything I would want in a car. Small but lots of space for pets and garden supplies. Xmas Tree taken home last year inside car was too tall for living room. Even tall son comfortable riding shotgun.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"I ordered my Fit without having ever been in one or having seen one in person. I searched for a small car with great gas mileage and the safety features I wanted for months. The Honda Fit was a perfect match. The comparable Toyota's did not include side curtain airbags and that would have been a very expensive add-on. I was called by my Honda dealer the day my car started being built and received updates every step of the way, which was really neat. I am 5'10"" and was nervous about buying such a small car especially since I'd never sat in one. It is just the slightest bit snug, but not uncomfortable. My boyfriend is 6'4"" and it's not the most comfortable car for him, but he rarely complains.
 
 Although my gas mileage isn't as good as I'd hoped for (I average right about 30 mpg each fill up), the space in the car is unbelievable. I just brought a new dishwasher home in my car yesterday, no trouble loading or unloading it. I can easily fit 10 bags of mulch and have moved many large, bulky items that wouldn't come close to fitting in any of the Toyota Camry's I used to have.
 
 I did have trouble when one of my tires had to be replaced. No place in the area carried the tires, which are rated for about 140 mph (with gas prices the way they are, I never go above 65 mph). The cost was comparable between the dealership and a tire place to special order the sport tires that go on the car. It cost about $130 for the tire (including mounting, balance, valve stems and disposal of the old tire). I wish the car came with a more standard sized tire and I think having a tire with a speed rating of 140 mph is pretty excessive and makes replacements ridiculously expensive.
 
 Overall, I'm very pleased with the car and the features. It is definitely worth every penny of the price.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"It's like riding in a tin can, if you lean on it to hard it leaves a dent and if a purse or bag brushes against ****************. However it does have a great pickup and great gas mileage. If you have a back neck or back, this would not be a good fit for you.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I bought a 2007 Fit Sport Automatic about an hour after the first US delivery back in May 2006. i now have almost 79,000 miles on it, and have kept track of my mileage the whole time. On open highway driving (e.g. thruway, country roads) I routinely get 40 mpg; combined city/highway (my usual daily grind involves a lot of city driving on the job), the mileage has never fallen below 36.
 I have to say I LOVE this car!! In 79,000 miles it has needed nothing but routine oil/air filter changes, 1 set of tires and 1 set of brakes. Handles like a dream, carries big & tall folks with comfort, and hauls an amazing amount of stuff (got an 8 foot Christmas tree in there with room to spare), and handles well on snow & ice.
 Only thing I would change about it is the cheapskate fabric on the interior and it needs some decent rugs on the floor.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Excellent car, gas mileage is great, excellent radio sound and overall, I love this CAR!!!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I love my Fit. It's zippy and I love driving it. It rides so smooth, I sometimes don't realize how fast I'm going.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I have a 2007 Fit and I love it. I was in a bad accident, my fault, in July. I was hit by a Ford SUV on my front fender. The car spun around but I was not hurt. The seat belt did leave some bruising but considering the SUV was going 60mph the car stood up very well. It cost $10,000 to repair and runs great. One thing I did learn is there is a blind spot between the windshield and passenger window. So be very careful when crossing a street, come to a complete stop, do not roll like I did because the SUV was in my blind spot and remained there as I rolled. I now stop, look to the right and make sure I look in front before I continue to cross. Other then my stupid mistake, I LOVE MY FIT and recommend the little jewel of a car. Thank you Honda for making such a great little car. It's great on gas, and sorry but I got 42 miles per gallon when I was traveling on the interstate.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I'm 6'2"" 275. My primary vehicle is a Honda Fit and indeed I fit nicely in it. The only exception being I wish the seat would go back just 1/2 more notch. I'm right on the verge of being completely comfortable.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Besides the slight inconvenience in legroom, I LOVE the car. I bought the 5 speed after years of driving an automatic and it's easy to shift and a blast to drive.",
2007,Honda,Fit,Over the hot summer I consistently got 36 MPG. With the AC off I got 38 MPG out of the last tank. I found the tire pressures were low so I brought them up to 32 PSI and hope to do even better this time. I expect 40 MPG. This is mixed driving... about 1:2 ratio of suburb:interstate.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"Would I recommend a Honda Fit? Put it this way, you aint gettin mine!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I gotta say ""I love this car"". So inexpensive, so much room & so fun to drive.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Every one laughs at how a big guy like me (6'4"", 360lbs) drives such a small car...then they see how much headroom I have & how I can put 3 other guys just as big as I am in the car...then it's ""WOW"".",
2007,Honda,Fit,"This is my 4th Honda & I'm thrilled at the car's quality & the level of dealer service. Penske Honda Ontario, CA is awesome. They have gone above & beyond in ensuring I have been happy. A far cry from the Ford store I worked at for 3 years.",
2007,Honda,Fit,The F1 paddle shifters make this SOOOO fun to drive.,
2007,Honda,Fit,The handling is GREAT as demonstrated the other night at 75mph when I had to avoid a crash & went from the #2 lane to #4 in one swerve. A wagon shouldn't handle this well.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"The car loves the redline! Put it in Sport Mode & paddle shift a smile on your face. Run her hard, she loves revs! Run it right up to 4500rpm & punch it to pass.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"The gas mileage is good ( I average 28mpg with 90%hwy driving of 75-80mph, I've gotten a couple 31-32mpg tanks) but of course not what the sticker says. However the 08 sticker is WAY closer to accurate. The mileage actually went up 2-3mpg using 91 octane from Shell, Mobile or Chevron - consistently! Comes out a wash in $ per mile but you go farther on a tank of fuel.",
2007,Honda,Fit,The ability for this thing to swallow cargo & large people is amazing. Bike? boxes galore? Moving? monthly shopping trip to Costco?..no problem.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"There are a few complaints but nothing major. The bumpers have had to be repainted due to peeling but Honda stepped right up. A simple spacer washer at the back edges stops the problem from recurring. The brakes seem to last about 19K miles but the pads are easy to change yourself. The car could be a little quieter inside but hey, not bad for the price.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Now for a few suggestions (listen up Honda): Rear disc brakes, Opt. Nav, Bluetooth, overhead console w/map lights, XM, steering wheel controls for radio & an armrest",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I like my Honda Sport Fit overall. It has power windows, tells you when to change the oil, has a theft alarm and cruise control included. For the price, it has alot more than older civic hatchback models. I got the Tangerine color and I love the color. It looks sharp at night with lights shining on it. There are just some things I wish Honda would improve on it. Let me just go over some possible improvements that would make it better:",
2007,Honda,Fit,"* It doesn't have an all wheel drive feature. If other cars this size can have it, why can't it be included as an option on the FIT?",
2007,Honda,Fit,* No arm rest for the driver. I find it a bit uncomfortable in terms of stearing long distances as there is no arm rest. The CRV has an armrest. Why can't the FIT have one?,
2007,Honda,Fit,* Why can't they offer a V6 engine option? Other models of this size offer it.,
2007,Honda,Fit,*The visors are a bit short and the sun can bother your eyes sometimes because you can't completely block it out.,
2007,Honda,Fit,* It has a great deal of room in the hatch for a car its size but it does have a limited weight capacity including the weight of the passengers. Be aware of this if you have heavy things to move.,
2007,Honda,Fit,* The air conditioning could be a bit stronger. I have to put it on the highest setting when it's really hot to cool the car off. The black apostery makes the car even hotter in the sun. They should give you a lighter color option but do not.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"* Maybe it's just me, but sometimes the drivers seats feels uncomfortable after a while.",
2007,Honda,Fit,* The fender is a bit too low. You can cause damage when you park with a sidewalk guard in front or in back of your vehicle or pulling out of a steep driveway if you are not careful.,
2007,Honda,Fit,* I got bilked by the dealer who had me pay $18K. Unfortunately I was desperate as my other Honda was lost in a flood and I had limited time to buy. The FIT was one of my primary considerations other than the Honda CRV and,
2007,Honda,Fit,"I love my Fit. It's great on the highway, great pick up and easy handling. I can pick up the grandkids and all their belongings and every one is comfortable. I can shop all day and everything fits.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"It looks small, but inside it is so big.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I drive 50 miles for work everyday and I only fill up once a week. I am so happy that I chose the Fit, I have never been as pleased with any car I have ever owned.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I purchased a 2007 base model Fit for my daughter to take to college and it's the perfect small car for school. As the other reviews mention, the interior is surprisingly large. I'm 6' 4"" and I have plenty of legroom and headroom. The back seat has more room than a Honda Civic and still ample luggage space behind the seats. Standard features on the base model include front and side airbags, power windows, and power assisted locks. ALL the seats recline (including the driver's seat) to provide amazing carrying capacity. A great feature is the rear seats that also fold up to provide a large well in the back for tall objects. This is the most flexible car I have seen. My daugher calls the car a mini minivan. Outside the car looks tiny, inside you think you are in a different much larger vehicle. Handling is brisk and the power is adequate. We bought the standard transmission and the linkage is solid and responsive. Since the car is so light the brakes and clutch are very sensitive and take a little getting used to. The stereo is just adequate, a place for an upgrade if you need enormous sound. Controls are very easy to use and logical. The materials are good but basic. I like the fact that it has the latest generation airbags for saftey since the car is so small. For the price I don't think you can beat the Fit. I originally looked at used Civics with about 40,000 miles but found they were priced only a couple thousand below the Fit and they did not have the same safety features. We own an Odyssey (140,000 miles) and a Civic and reliability has been terrific. I expect the same for the Fit. This should be an ideal car for city driving.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"It's a tiny car outside, but huge and spacius inside. The only disappointment for me is the mileage.It is not as advertised. I can barely get 26 miles per gallon in city driving and definitely below 30 on the highway. However, it could be a matter of adjustment the dealer could do, as most of reviewers agree with manufacturer's figures. Besides it is quiet inside, has all contemporary amenities incl. ABS and AC plus good radio and disc player.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Price I paid is 15.250, slightly above advertised, but acceptable regarding ""fit and finish"" of the car.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Highly recommended. Good, reliable car from a respectable manufacturer for a decent price.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Overall, it's been a top notch car. I've driven it everywhere, and it has proven to be a reliable. It handles well, feels safe and responds quickly. I also love the roominess of the car and the retro chicness of it, too. Most of all, I think it's the best car you can buy for the value and style. My only disappointment is that the gas mileage isn't as great as advertised. I end up averaging about 28 to 31 miles per gallon. It's still pretty good but I would like it to be higher. Other than that, it's a keeper!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"What is a Fit? Four months ago my wife told me that she and her friend both wanted to buy a Honda Fit. And trade in our roomy SUV to get it. I have two sons who are 6'4"" and 6'2"". No way!... I thought. The boys both ""Fit"" in the back seat without us having to move the front seats forward!. Plenty of headroom and even with the 4 of us we get 36 miles per gallon on our monthly trips to state parks. (People do a double-take when we exit the car) My wife gets right at 30 mpg in aggressive (she can't let others pass her) city driving. Handling is - fun, crisp and actually brings a joy to my face. (Handling actually reminds me of our Mazda Miata) Our friend recently had a bad encounter with a deer and it will cost her $1800 to repair (damage to headlight fixture, fender, front bumper and hood). I thought the quotes were quite reasonable. She also loves her Fit!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I've had the Fit Sport for 15 months and 15k miles, no issues to report. Mileage is as advertised, I've read some reviews where it doesn't meet, but mine meets. I use the cruise control a lot and keep the speed a bit over 55. The A/C works great, I would suggest tinting the window's beyond factory level to help keep out the UV Rays, lots of glass in this car, made a difference in mine. Driving is comfortable, lots of passenger room (I'm 6'3"" and people sit behind me) Road noise is mid level, but don't forget this is a economy car, I might install some noise dampening down the road? Radio, controls, ergonics are on the money. I'm looking forward to keeping this a long time, but I did hear there might be a hybrid '09 ??? I would easily recommend, the days of gas guzzling tanks are over...",
2007,Honda,Fit,"After having the Fit for a Year it's a Great Little car. Fuel mileage is exactly what they state. I've been averaging 34-37 MPG. I use the Fit for everything, commuting to work, getting the kiddies to school and getting things for around the house.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"It's not a bad car. It's just that the gas mileage ratings are way too hyped up. It should be illegal to make such outrageous claims as they do. In fact, I believe a lot of Honda Fit owners should be paid back some $ for the lies. Max gas mileage, which is freeway by the way, is no more than 26mpg. I'm completely disgusted with Honda Corp. for doing this. Not to mention at about 11k miles the brakes are going out. The AC doesn't work 100%; I mean come on Honda. AC, especially in California in this 110 degree weather, is absolutely necessary. I should have bought the Nissan Versa.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"The fit does what it should with aplomb. Granted gas milage figures are optimistic,but my figures reflect real world 26.7 in town and 32.1 on road, Honda sport with 9300 miles on it, but the driving position is from heck. I let my wife do most of the driving. I am only 5'9"" and my right leg cramps badly. Back seat is very roomy and passenger (front) is comfy but it needs either a telescoping steering wheel or move gas pedal forward. I have tried pillows for height etc. Aside from that one problem the fit gives great value for the money.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I heard about the car doing research online. It had great reviews and everyone talked about interior storage space. That is what I wanted, and it is great for hauling all my storage bins. It looks small from the outside but is very spacious inside. It's no luxury car for sure, but seats are quite comfortable. More than road noise, I hear the engine. My biggest complaint would be the AC. It can't cool enough for me in this FL heat during the day. Nights are fine. It as also noisy at full blast. This car handles great! I like swithing to the paddle drive every now and then, especially on long trips. Even with an extra load in the back, I am getting the milage they advertised for city driving. It would have been nice to have an option for a sunroof. I also liked the airbags that are standard, and hopefully the car itself would be safe should there be an impact. Time will tell on safety and durability since I have to keep it outside.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"After driving an '88 Honda Civic hatchback for 17 years, it has been a very pleasant transition to the 2007 Fit. The Fit follows in the distinctive Honda tradition (we have owned and driven Hondas since 1979). Functionality, handling and fuel economy have exceeded my expectations. Strongly recommend for anyone needing a practical car that's attractive and fun to drive (the 5-speed is very responsive!) The interior is really flexible, and reconfiguring the space for people vs. cargo is virtually effortless. Looking forward to at least 17 years of driving this Honda!",
2007,Honda,Fit,we bought our fit april 2006 and have 24000 miles on it now.no problems thus far.its the best thing we have bought in years.real comfey and fun to drive.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"I just bought a Fit. The first gas tank refill computed at 36.2 miles per gallon, that was a mix of city and highway driving. The car appears to be as advertised ... adequate power, excellent handling, roomy interior. The air conditioner worked well even in 103 degree heat. The car (Sport Model) came with daytime running lights, which got me a small insurance discount, and it has antitheft features that may or may not get a discount on comprehensive insurance. The rear seats are roomy, even for my 6' tall son, but I think the seat backs are too vertical for an adult for a long trip (more than an hour or so).",
2007,Honda,Fit,Negatives? Only two so far:,
2007,Honda,Fit,"1 - Honda accessories are expensive. The dealer wanted $120 for floor mats, mats that didn't look much better than the $20 mats I bought from Wal-Mart. Don't lose a key, a replacement is $140 because of ""programming the computer chip."" I certainly hope that by the time the 3 year bumper-to-bumper warranty expires reasonably priced repair parts are available (plugs/filters/tires/ etc.).",
2007,Honda,Fit,"2 - There is no locking compartment for pilferable items such as a camera, a gps, etc. You can conceal some small items with the spare tire, under the back cover, but if you regularly carry a tool kit, flashlight, tire pump, and so on you will probably want to buy a lockable minifootlocker and affix it in the ""trunk"" area to defeat ""smash and grab"" burglars.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I love my Fit. It's responsive, handles well, and is fun to drive. Wish it got the mileage promised, however! I've only had mine a few weeks.... they gave me a free tank of gas, and when I filled up and calculated mileage, it was substantially less than an average of the projected 38 MPG freeway / 33 town adverstised on the sticker. [I have the manual transmission, so I'm supposed to get better mileage than one can expect from the automatic version.] The gear stick is a bit stiff, but that's getting smoother as I drive it more. It's comfortable, roomy, versatile, and peppy. In other words ..... FUN!!! :) It also has some nice luxury features you don't expect to find on an economy car... power windows, CD player, cruise control, power assist, etc. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a smaller economy car with practical space useage, good handling and comfort. The back seats have more leg room than my friend's Accord! [Partially it's because they sit higher, so your butt's not below your knees!] Anyway, I've had it less than a month, but so far so good! Hopefully the mileage will improve when the car is broken in. I'm having a blast with it and am hoping to enjoy many years of good reliable service of the sort one has come to expect of Honda products. This design is a winner!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I am so glad that I bought my Fit. I looked at Toyota, Subaru, Pontiac. The fit was the only car that was roomy, you definetly don't feel that you are in a economy car. Plus its sporty. So glad that Honda now offers us this model.",
2007,Honda,Fit,I LOVE MY FIT.......,
2007,Honda,Fit,I love driving this car. I had a Malibu and I gave it to my husband because it was too big. This car is so much fun to drive and it comes with alot of safety features. Fit all the way.,
2007,Honda,Fit,This car is great. it has a spacious interior that even tall/large peoplecan fit easily into. the versatile way that the seats can be modified make it able to use the cargo/seating area many ways. the exterior is cute and in my test drives I found it the quietest and best handling of my considerations. I am definitly happy with my choice.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"I PURCHASED MY NEW FIT SPORT MODEL THREE MONTHS AGO AND IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST ENJOYABLE CAR TO OPERATE.I COMPARE IT WITH MY OTHER HONDA AUTOMOBILES PURCHASED IN THE PAST,I.E.,TWO HONDA ACCORDS,TWO CRV'S ALL NEW AND BY FAR,THE WINNER IN ALL CATEGORIES,THE HONDA FIT!!!!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Excellent, have one will buy ten more !",
2007,Honda,Fit,"This was the first brand new car that I bought and I'm so glad that I did! I have the Base Model with a 5-speed Manual Transmission and I absolutely adore it. The Fit drives wonderfully with amazing handling and unbelievably quick responses. It is sporty and fun, has great gas mileage and is very affordable.",
2007,Honda,Fit,I would recommend this vehicle to anyone!,
2007,Honda,Fit,"Can't say enough positive things about it. Had this car just over a year now. Drives and handles like a sports car, consistant 31-40 mpg. (Want the best mileage. Keep tire pressure 3-5 lbs higher than called for, switch to Amsoil Synthetic and Amsoil oil filter) This is my wifes car, but I'm 6' 3"" and one Son-in-law is 6'6"" and still plenty of headroom, legroom, etc.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Most versatile of all the econo vehicles, hands down, I can carry items my Accord and others like it,cannot.",
2007,Honda,Fit,I know Dealers are still complaigning about not getting enough of these. We ordered ours like most others at our dealer. Took two months. Well worth the wait.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"I have owned the Fit for almost 15 months now and the novelty of having the ""cutest"" car around has certainly worn off. First of all gas mileage is not what they say.....even on the highway. That was a big disappointment to begin with. There is also alot of road noise and, in my opinion, it should have atlest a 1.8 under the hood. Sometimes it feels like I can't get out of my own way because the pick-up is not good at all.",
2007,Honda,Fit,TERRIBLE IN WINTER WEATHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
2007,Honda,Fit,I got stuck every time it snowed.....what a nightmare.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"However, the amount of room inside is second to none. I am a courier and I use the vehicle primarily for work. Perfect for that kind of thing. Also, I am the mother of 4 and we have plenty of room to take long rides comfortably. It's no mini-van but my girls are all between the ages of 10 & 12 so we fit well. The stereo is awesome. It really kicks out some great sound. The A/C is also very cold.",
2007,Honda,Fit,Overall......I have enjoyed my time with the fit but I am looking forward to trading it soon for something else.,
2007,Honda,Fit,"(The trim package I have is a 5door Sport, but the drop down menu here did not that have selection available.)",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I love my fit! It's a five door compact car that they somehow made have TONS of space inside. They attribute the some of the space to moving the gas tank under the front seats. The interior space is comparable to the accord, seriously. Also, the seating is very flexible, as you can fold the seats down or up in a number of combinations. You can fit anything in the Fit!!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I have the sport version, which means things like alloy rims(!),fog lights, a better stereo w/auxillary jack for mp3s, and shifter knobs. You can even shift the car into sport mode, in which you control the gears soley with the shifter knobs.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I got the pearl blue fit, and I ordered the accessories from Honda like the interior blue trim on the side doors, the dash,the steering wheel, and knob shifter. The meters and the radio lcd is all in a nice blue color.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"As for ""cons"", the engine is not very powerful, and the car handles well, but it's very springy on turns since it's a light car. There is no sunroof, even on the sport model. Also, oddly enough, there is no passenger side mirror!",
2007,Honda,Fit,"Before this car, I had a '95 Civic. The fit reminds me of that car a lot. It's reliable, small, and affordable! The new civics are now bigger and very powerful. The Fit is basically the new Civic.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"If you're looking for an inexpensive car with a LOT of functionality, this is it. And to boot, it's cute.",
2007,Honda,Fit,"I have been very pleased with the inside room. I previously had a Mini Cooper and both my husband and I think the Fit handles easier, has more inside room, and we definitely like the 4 doors. The gas mileage isn't as good as advertized, but I have been driving it in town with the air-conditioner on.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"The five speed trans shifts smoothly and the Fit seems to have very low roll resistance adding to the increase in gas milage. I am 5'6"" and the driving position/seats lack lumbar support. I use a small pillow at the small of my back to help on long trips. Honda would have a real top winner with improved seating and perhaps a telescoping steering wheel. Honda does not offer cruise control in the manual transmission models. The gas pedal tends to cramp the foot due to the overall driving position so a sport model with auto trans and cruise control would alleviate this discomfort. Still, the driving position tends to place the legs and knees in a ""high"" position that I find uncomfortable on long trips. Otherwise this is a great commuter car that will most likely be very dependable. I get an average of 33 mpg city and 38 mpg highway.",
2008,Honda,Fit,I own a 2008 Fit with a stick shift. I think it is a very unsafe car because the pedals are so small and close together. You can apply the brake and gas pedal at the same time very easily. It would probably be safer if it was an automatic.,
2008,Honda,Fit,My Fit is awesome. The only issue I run into is the pick up. I like to get off the line quick. But I haven't had any problems with the vehicle. I use it for everything I need from food shopping to transporting my bike to the trail. Its versatile and the interior is unbelievably spacious.,
2008,Honda,Fit,"My husband and I bought the 2008 Fit Sport last March and couldn't be happier. We get 40 to 45 mpg in town and on the road. My husband is 6'4"" and has no trouble getting in and out and twice has driven it to Tn. to visit our daughter. I show my dogs, a toy breed and it is nothing to get 4 to 6 dogs, crates, grooming tables and all the other stuff you always take in the back with the seats down. What a wonderful little car....sue",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I love my 2008 Sport Honda Fit. I brought my car in June 2008. At first i didnt like how it looked but once i got use to it and drove it i fell in love. It may look small but there is a lot of space. The back seats can fold up or down depending on how u want them. The mpg is GREAT. My gas tank was almost on ""E"" and it took only $15 to fill my tank. Gas was at $2.15 per gallon. I would recommend this car to everyone.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I bought my Fit in 12/07. I downscaled from a 
 sport package Mini Cooper. Not flashy, but a Honda-its the base model, no extras at all. Pluses: gas mileage & unlike the Mini takes regular gas. The back seats when they are down -a ton of room. Minus's-the tires are tiny and it seems they always need air. I don't miss my Mini as much as I thought I would. Gets me from point A to point B---Reccomended!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I bought a new honda fit sport 5sp. Over period of 5000+ miles have averaged 40+ miles per gallon (city and road). Am 6'3 and have all the room I need. routinely carry 350 lbs of corn in rear, in bags, with no problem, and plenty of room for other items. Best car I ever owned in 65 yrs. of life. holds 4 adults with room to spare. Plenty of power and fun to drive. Spacious,comfortable, fuel efficient. Needs only better intermittent wipers to be perfect.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"one of the best items i have purchased in the last 20 years. fit is a lot of fun drive, spacious, and very quick for a 4 banger. i am 6'4 door are very easy to get out of, handels like a miny sports car,steering is very responsive, like the paddle shifter when driving, very tight and solid when driving and quality for a small car is great. when it comes down to it you can't beat a honda of any kind. (truth)",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I love my Honda Fit! I have a manual transmission, and I regularly get 37-38 mpg. I get 40 tp 41 mpg on highway driving. It handles really well, even in snow, and is fun to drive. It has an amazing amount of room, even in the back seat. We took it on vacation this summer and my husband did most of the driving. He's 6'5"" and was quite comfortable driving it.",
2008,Honda,Fit,I bought a FIT last year and love it EXCEPT: within 90 days I had to replace all 4 tires. They all had pin prick size holes by the rims. I kept taking the car back because the tires were low or flat within 3 days of airing them up. The dealership basically told me to get bent. I would recommend the FIT but NOT Honda El Paso Dealership!,
2008,Honda,Fit,"My Fit is the most fun car I've ever owned. It handles like a sports car. It gets great gas mileage. Goes really well for a small engine. The inside is very spacious, quite deceiving considering it's size. The folding seats are so easy to use, can be moved around with little effort. Can accomidate almost anything from groceries to furniture. Has gone on longer roadtrips with no problems. Great standard stereo and sound with MP3 capabilities. Would definitely not trade it in for a stupid... I mean SmartCar. :P",
2008,Honda,Fit,"We haven't had a car in five years..our F-350 has served that purpose as well as tow our home. We wanted a vehicle that would get good milegae as well as being comfortable. I'm 6' and I am comfortable wherever I sit in the vehicle. As we have been moving in and cleaning out, we have had numerous trips where we've used the back storage area. Plenty of room (remember to watch how much weight you put back there). Mileage..we've been tracking..typically running around town, etc we're in the high 20's to low 30's. On highways we typically run at 2100 rpm or 60-63 MPH and have gotten over 40MPG as a standard. Our maiden voyage on a trip to St Louis from Northern Ill garnered us 42 MPG. Recently, our tire pressure monitor said tires were low..I checked and pumped them all up to required psi. We then drove (highway) to a function and back and the gauge barely moved. For that 200 miles we were at 48 MPG. Need less to say, it has met and exceeded our expectations. It still can't haul the 5th wheel but it helps a lot otherwise. For RVers..according to the Honda book it is towable...I contacted their customer service and they also said it was one of two vehicles (our's is an 2008). You should verify this for yourself before hooking one up.
 
 Only drawback we see on our model - which isn't the Sport is that there is no cruise control.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"Okay, ''favoritest'' isn't a word but it describes the way I feel about my 2007 Blaze Orange Metallic Honda Sport Fit. Easy handling, plenty of storage space, and a whole lot more features combine to make the Fit a winner. I am proud to be a FitFreak!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"Just got my Fit the first week in July. I love it! It is fun to drive, easy to manuever and has loads of room for a small car. Everyone comments on how cute they think it is. Gas mileage is better than my old car so I am happy. I average 28-31mpg in city and highway, not as good as others have mentioned.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"Been driving my Honda Fit since October of 07, really Fun... I love it makes me feel young and alive.Good for City driving great for getting into small parking spaces",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I recently left my corporate job where I had a company car for 10 years. Needless to say, I had to look into not only purchasing my own car, but my own insurance, and city taxes, stickers, etc. Leasing was out of the question, because in Chicago, there's an extra lease tax on top of a vehicle tax. My initial preference would have been a hybrid, with gas prices being so high. However, even teh used hybrids are expensive when one is not used to factoring in the price of a car into their budget. Thus, I researched cars for months based on fuel economy, safety, and affordability. I came up with the Honda Fit. Unfortunately, they're not so easy to find in the Chicago area. Once I did, however, I negotiated a great price. I've had it since May, and I've been calculating my mpg's ever since. Ive had to drive to Ohio on a few occasions. My highway mpg's, going 75, with the AC on and tons of luggage, has been 42 MPG!!!!! My city has ranged between 32 and 38!!!! Plus, my payments on the car, after 5000 down, have been 200/mo. for 5 years. Can't beat that, when the depreciation is a mere 49% after 5 years.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"ive had this car for 10 months and i love it. i love the sport model for its sport car appearance and its fun attitude. The pick up is not as great as most other cars but once it gets there, it goes. the only thing i ******* would have come with is a sunroof. i know you can get it installed but it would be nice to get a car with a sunroof already there. this car is great for highway/city driving but dont take it out to the country. does not do well going through pot holes. this care makes a wonder first car for anyone!!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"We bought a Honda Fit to ease the pain of writing checks to fuel stations trying to keep our Pacifica on the road. Our neighbors also got one within a month of ours. It has been interesting comparing our mpg's etc. I have the turbo, which uses a bit more gas, so we get about 27 city/34 highway. The turning radius is spectacular, it has awesome ""pick-up"" and doesn't bog out like some small engines will do. The only issue I have with the engine is that the gears are a little loud, especially 1st to 2nd. There seems to be some slipage. I would purchase this car again over it's comps because of the extras that come with the FIT. MP3, Cd Player, multi use storage and seating. The car does need to be cleaned inside more often than any other car I have owned because the seats are black velour and show every stray crumb, dust particle etc. Also, I hope Honda changes the texture of the dash because it traps dust particles like crazy. However, these are just cosmetic issues, I still love the car and enjoy ""babying"" it!!! Would highly recommend.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I have never really cared what kind of car I drove as long as it got me there in one piece. But I absolutely love my FIT. Wouldn't trade it for anything. It makes me smile everytime I look at it. Roomy with more than enough room to spare for anything you would want to carry. We went on a 900 mile trip this summer, and didn't feel cramped. People are always stopping us to ask us how we like it, and we can't say enough great things about it. It is economical to purchase, maintain and run. Haven't regretted it for one single moment!!!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"Great car , very practical for passengers and cargoI get an average of 35 miles per gallon between city and highway I make sure to stay under 2000 RPM or as close to it as possible and it makes a great differenceThe best part of owning a Fit is the look of big SUV owners at the gas station.I feel their pain and enjoy it",
2008,Honda,Fit,"Great value, lots of bang for the buck, hard to find though. I'm 6'7"" and I can drive this vehicle, front doors open wide for easy entry and exit. Has more room inside than what it looks like from the outside. I'd go with the sport model, you get alot of extras for so little money. Ride is firm, steering is tight and responsive, this car will turn on a dime. Fun to drive on curvy rural roads and gets lots of looks from other drivers. With rising gas prices this is a great way to haul people and/or trips to the store. Lots of storage space,especially with back seats folded flat.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"getting used to, however the fit made the transition easy. the stated mpg is conservative, i get 38/40 city/highway; it is very responsive and roomy; of course, over 65 the mileage drops. it is more economical round 60 mph. i've always had american, but there is really nothing american available in this class with the quality, mpg, interior room, cup holders, stereo, versatility (fold-down seats, hatchback), rear wiper, great a/c, and resale. never part with the buick (just waiting to hit the lottery or an oil well!) several additions help, after-market arm rest (easily installed) and leather seats, at a local shop, add to seat comfort (add color inserts to make it really hot.) fits are hard to find at the dealer, and they sometimes have add-ons to add to the price (shop around.) overall its been a great experience and it's fun to drive (be defensive!!) definitley recommended.",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I have had my FIT for about 10 months and I drive a lot!! It is absolutely perfect for my fiance and I. It also has enough room for a car seat for my 2 year old niece. I love this car. It looks great, drives great, and gets great gas mileage!!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"I love driving this car. A lot of pep, easy to maneuver and park.I'm a ""big"" guy and the Fit is remarkably comfortable.",
2008,Honda,Fit,It does nearly everything very well. After 9K the new fit is still new feeling. It should last a long time - flawless so far.,
2008,Honda,Fit,"I have only driven this car for 300 miles or so, but I like it. It has ample pick up. The quality of the interior is excellent, great radio. My main car is a Mercedes, and I use it for my long trips. Obviously the Mercedes is a more powerful, a more comfortable, and a safer car, but it also cost me over twice as much. The Bose radio in the Mercedes is better, but not by that much which surprised me. I enjoy driving the Fit. It handles well and the gas mileage I'm sure will put the Mercedes to shame. I still haven't yet had to fill it up. The amount of stuff this car can carry is phenomenal. So far the car has been flawless, but remember I've only driven miles or so.",
2008,Honda,Fit,We have had manyy Honda's over the years. They have always been low on maintenance and great on milage and great resale. This car also had a five star safety rating. It stops on a dime with anti-lock brakes. The sport( baddle shifters) has a lot of zip for merging in traffic when you need it. All in all she loves her car. And we feel confident about its safety. Since she learned to drive in a Yukon XL she is aware about the difference in mass and is extra cautious when pulling out into traffic.,
2008,Honda,Fit,We are 8000 miles into our 2007 Honda Fit. It is a great car. We regularly get 40 miles per gallon and more on some tankfuls. Five hour trips are comfortable. The car seats four adults comfortably. The interior space is surprising and very flexible. Four airbags and antilock brakes are standard. We are extremely happy with this car. Would recommend it and would buy it again.,
2008,Honda,Fit,"This is a commuter car. I would not suggest it for anything else. However, maybe for a collage student would like to have this as a 1st car just to get around. Maybe it could be used for a second car or by someone who will not be on the road other that to drive to school or work... My question is the safety of the car. It's a real small car and there is not much protection for those inside. So one must be careful going down an open road at 70 miles per hour. The back will only handle 2 people and it is a tight fit... Well that is the name -- right!",
2008,Honda,Fit,"The gas mileage seems to be great, but I am sure that it's less than what's stated on the sticker. These days gas milage is the most important thing to consider...",
2009,Honda,Fit,"We have had our 2009 Fit for almost a year, and my wife and I love everything about it. It has amazing cargo room for a small car, and the seats are so easy to fold into place to permit this room. The Fit is a really solid car, feels great to drive, and is certainly not wimpy in acceleration. The seats are comfortable and easy to get into. The ride is good for a subcompact. It is an excellent car for the road or just around town.",
,,,"When I bought my Fit a year ago I was looking for a small car with a tight turning radius, a car I could take on road trips with bikes stowed in back, a car that could haul gardening and home improvement stuff, a car with good mileage, and a car with superior engineeering and safety. I got all of this with my Fit. The Fit's strength is city driving -- great gas mileage, great maneuverability, nice tight U-turns, and a nice jack-rabbit start from stop lights. It does fine on road trips, where I run it all day at 75 mph, getting 36 mpg, but it has zero extra power for passing, so be aware of this power situation. Excellent stability conrol saved my life -- really -- one day on a bad wet weather spin-out. One strange thing: it doesn't have automatic headlight switch-off when you park the car, so it's possible to forget and leave the lights on and come back to find a dead battery. Also, the on-board computer reminds you of maintenance tasks, which is fine, but the Owner's Manual should also include the standard chart of what to do at how many miles, but it doesn't. I'm glad the 2009 model has had no recalls. I'm very happy I bought this car.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"What a joy this car has turned out to be. I've always driven sports cars - Miata, Alfa Romeos, Audis, even an old Morgan. The Fit drives like my old Miata but has room for 4 people or tons of stuff with the magic seats folded down. It is very spirited, sporty, responsive -- really zippy to drive.
 
 Visibility is great, better than any other small SUV, small sports wagon in it's class. The ""extra"" side windows front and back remove nearly all the blind spots, which was a real problem for my short wife on all other cars we tested. Being up a bit higher than the average car is a real positive on SUV filled freeways.
 
 I had doubts about getting an automatic transmission in a small engine car, but the 5 speed automatic has the fastest and most positive shifts of any automatic I've driven other than the Audi/TDI DSG tranny. Shifts up and down by the cruise control are very precise -- no hunting up and down with hilly terrain. The shift paddles on the steering wheel are a nice touch, seldom needed but really nice when you want to downshift to pass or just have some fun.
 
 Mileage has been 32+ so far for city and hilly freeways. I expect it to go up a few MPG on flat commutes.
 
 The blue sensation pearl paint is stunning.
 
 There is great attention to detail in the design - 6 cupholders in front (2 of them are right in front of the A/C vent so drinks stay cold!) Side pockets and storage abound. Instrumentation is well positioned and lighted so is very visible, all controls are easy to reach and intuitive to use.
 
 Only things I have needed to add are drop-down extensions for the visors and a dash cover.
 
 We bought the car on the next to the last day of the clunkers program and the salesman and entire dealership were very friendly and completely service oriented, the most pleasurable car buying experience I have ever had. We got the promised price thru a buyers club program despite the dealership expecting to sell out all remaining Fits (which they did!).",
2009,Honda,Fit,"Love our 2009 Fit. I have the revolution orange 2009 fit. I cannot believe how many people come to ask us about our new car. It is economical, spacious and looks great. We have had no problems or complaints. I had the rear Windows tinted for added privacy. The only trouble has been finding snow chains. This has a new tire size.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"The headrest on the 09 FIT pushes the driver's head uncomfortably forward. Needs to be redesigned. The paddles on the steering wheel obstruct the view of the ""lights"" indicator on the steering column. I have approx. 1,000 miles on the odometer and calculate the mpg at 34 to 37 mpg. My plan is to tow the FIT, four down, behind my RV. If anyone is towing the FIT, please let me know. Other than the two complaints above, I love the FIT.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"Bought this to replace an older Jeep Wrangler that was on it's last leg. Needed a vehicle that would carry 4 people, or 2 people and 2 dogs. This car is AMAZINGLY spacious on the inside. But also wanted something economical on gas and low-maintenance. Honda is excellent in that respect, always a trustworthy brand. It drives very smoothly and is a comfortable ride. It is great for hauling stuff (shopping, auction finds, animals, luggage, etc.) All this wrapped up into a small price tag made this a no-brainer for us.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"Have had car for 4 months. Has Nav system and all the options. Generally agree with the 5 star ratings BUT there are some changes needed. They include: Horrible reflection on windshield-had to put down a antireflective matt to see out on sunny days. The mileage gauge (AVG MPG) is way off. Mine reads 15-20% higher than actual mileage. I am a large person (6-1,220 lbs and the seats don;t provide enough lateral or thigh support. Do love the iPod connections but you can forget the card-reader behind the screen-that must be an ex-USA feature.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"I love my 2009 Honda Fit Sport. It is so comfortable to drive,
 handles well, gets great gas mileage (32-40mpg) , and is easy on the eyes, too! I like the alert lights-- from tire pressure to air bags to
 lights. Visibility is massive and the windshield wipers cover the entire
 window. It looks like a small car, but it is anything but small.
 The turning radius makes parking and maneuvering a breeze. The space inside for passengers and cargo is amazing. 
 
 It is the best car all-round that I have ever owned. I have absolutely no regrets.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"I just purchased my 2009 Honda Fit, what a great car. I love it and so far, have gotten 39 mpg around town. More room inside then it looks, and so much fun to drive. I never buy anything but Honda's and this was certainly a wise purchase.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"This is my 2nd Fit. I had an '07 that left when my ex and I split. I traded in a 4Runner for this one and, as much as I loved my SUV, I have no regrets. I use this frequently to haul my son and his hockey equipment around the West. It holds a ton of gear. If the on board computer is accurate, I'm getting over 40 mpg with almost 6000 miles on the car...nice. The driver's position, while not perfect, is much better than the earlier version (I'm 6-2). The telescoping/tilt steering wheel is a great improvement. I still find Honda's design that prevents a view of the front end of the car uncomfortable but the front is short so it's not a major problem. 
 
 This car has changed the way I drive. I'm constantly aware of my mpg and strive to keep it high by slowing down. It's a much more relaxing way to drive.
 
 If you're into utility and economy, this car is wonderful. I highly recommend it.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"It drives like a sports car, carries cargo like a samll SUV, reduces fuel consuption and enviornmental impact like a hybrid and is solid as a tank.
 
 At first I was hesitant because I never have owned a vehicle in this size category (mini/subcompact). My experience so far tells me I made the right decision.
 My current MPG is 40.1 combined city/expressway/tollroad.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"This car is wonderful! I am a big guy and even though the car is not big it is very easy to get and out of the auto. The hatchback and drop down seats make it extremely easy to haul something in the back- the handling is wonderful, the mileage is great!
 I DEFINITELY recommend this car- there is nothing 'negative' to say about it! BRAVO Honda!!!",
2009,Honda,Fit,"I WAS A CHEVY MALIBU OWNER FOR 10 YEARS...I LEASED A 1998, 2001, 2004 (THIS CAR WENT THRU 5 STEERING COLUMNS) AND A 2005 (I LEMONED MY 2004 IN FOR THIS ONE AND THIS ONE WAS GOING ON ITS 3RD STEERING COLUMN WHEN I TRADED IT IN FOR MY NEW LOVE...MY HONDA FIT! I'VE OWNED IT FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS AND AM JUST AT A 1/2 TANK....OMG!
 
 I HAVE NOT ONE NEGATIVE THING TO SAY...EXCEPT GM CARS (QUALITY WISE AND PRICE WISE) SUCK COMPARED TO MY NIMBLE, QUIK, CUTE, SPRTY FIT!
 
 DONT MISS OUT, GET ONE!",
2009,Honda,Fit,"It has been nearly 2 months since the purchase of my 2009 Fit. Must say, to date very impressed. The 2009 re-design has done done wonders for the exterior, while keeping (& improving) interior functionality. Likes: style, standard features, gas mileage, 4 door hatcback, roominess, functionality & practicality of interior, electronic steering and manueverability on city streets.
 Dislikes: Stability control only offered with nav. system, turn signals not integrated into side view mirrors (as they are in European Jazz), blind spots on right & left side near D pillars and steering wheel (miss 4 spoke steering wheel).
 I traded a 2000 Civic with 154k+ miles on it for the Fit and have not been disappointed. So far the gas mileage has been good for a non-hybrid on a commute in mostly city driving - 34 mpg. Am interested in seeing what the mpg will be on road trips. When choosing which version - I chose Sport because of standard features for $$.",
2009,Honda,Fit,Have been driving the 2009 Fit Sport for a month now. My Mpg with the auto is 40Mpg on each of the last 4 tanks with about 25% highway driving. The Fit is fun to drive and drives bigger than its size. For an urban car this Fit is the best!,
2009,Honda,Fit,"we had a 2007 fit that was totaled in June, after finding out the changes for the 2009 fit we waited until it was available and are happy we did. We like the new body style and the new bigger windows on the front sides of the car, the extra cup holders are nice as well. We purchased the fit with navigation because of the stability option. The interior is nice as well. The new seats are much better than the old ones and don't seem to collect all the lint like the 2007 seats did; the extra interior room does make a difference, I like the extra head room as well. we like the new gas tank cover as well. The improvements 
 are great. Thanks Honda, we really LOVE OUR FIT!!!",
2009,Honda,Fit,"I LOVE my Fit. I went from an SUV to the Fit a little over a week ago and I cannot be happier. It has a zippy drive, plenty of not only cargo room but that ever important headroom. The upgraded look of the interior design improvements were well worth the wait. And, I completely disagree with the reviewer who questioned the exterior styling. I think it is a 100% improvement over the 2008. I've only had it a week so I cannot vouch for the mileage yet, but with a ten gallon tank I went over 200 miles, all in town driving on its first nine gallons. The sport is worth the extra cash and still a deal over all the others in its class. And, believe me I drove them all before buying my Fit. Honda does it again.",
2009,Honda,Fit,"Just bought the car! We are amazed that such a small car can have so much room on the inside! We are a family of six footers and have plenty of room!
 The gas mileage is excellent! Good luck finding these cars at the dealerships though!",
2009,Honda,Fit,"a 2009 Honda fit about a month ago and I love it. I drive 133 miles round trip to work. The 33mpg highway is a joke. When I fill up it's more than 40mpg I'm getting!!! Granted it's all turnpike, but still it's saving me about $70.00 a month in gas. The driver seat is roomy and comfortable and the adjustment sterring column is great. The dashboard cup holders are the best. Visibility is fantastic. The hatchback and adjustability of the back seats are terrific for boxes and tall objects.
 
 The only negative is that the ride is a little rough. ******** not a luxury sedan, and the handling is superb.",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"I like this van, however within first two years had the tire pressure monitor, front engine mount, power steering reservoir and torque converter replaced and the powertrain control module has been reprogramed several times. Now it is being recalled for brake problems. And let's just say that working with dealers and Honda customer care group has been an interesting experience.",
,,,"Braking problems, sloppy interior trim, road noise, lousy performance and gas milage.",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"This is a top quality vehicle. It can haul butt if needed handles well and the leather interior is comfortable on long trips. The michelins take some time to get used to but they are good tires. They burp air so keep them pressed up weekly and you'll get 40k miles easily. 
 
 It doesn't have the splash and panache of the Toyota Sienna but it does have quality inside and out. I love the little hideaway boot. A great place for my Nikons when I have to give them a rest. She's strong and safe. You may never be head over heals in love with it but it won't let you down. The engine is a very high performer but gentle on the pumps.
 Enjoy it!",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"After owning numerous Chrysler Vans there is no valid comparison. When Chrysler went to stow & go seating it resulted in less seat comfort than a comercial airplane, if I wanted a seat like that I would have stuck to a horse & buggy. Odyssey is pure luxury seating. The engine performance is outstanding as is its brakes. We are very satisfied with this van, in fact so impressed that I now also own a new Honda Ridgeline. It's too bad we can't give it 6 Stars.",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"This is my 2nd Odyssey. I bought my first one *********** bought my 2nd one 250,000 miles later in 2007; and the '97 was still running well!
 The 2007 one is heavier, more comfortable and a much smoother ride. I LOVE IT! Lots of cool storage space and I think I get around 23 MPG and I do a fair amount of highway driving. Lots of room and it's great on a road trip. My next vehicle will probably be another Odyssey in another 10 years.",

2007,Honda,Odyssey,"I went back to the dealership today 10/31/07 and asked why my brand new Odyssey was not getting the good mileage per gallon.The answer was, the Cars were tested in a controlled environment at the factory and acknowledge that they knew it can't get the advertized mileage to a gallon. They have to sell the car with what it says on the sticker, a misleading info, which says 19mile city and 28 miles hwy driving.Disgusting and deceptive at best..!!! I am frustrated.",
2007,Honda,Odyssey,"The Odyssey quality fit, form and function is beyond reproach. The fuel consumption is very satisfactory after the break in oil is changed out.

2007,Honda,Odyssey,"I considered getting a Saturn Outlook, which I liked, but had some reservations. I wanted a sun roof, the kids wanted a DVD player. In the Outlook, I could only get one of the other and pay like 40000. Then a friend of ours got one, so I got to see one up close. I loved the back windows roll up and down, and howt he seats in the back pull down. So I went and drove one. And I loved it. The kids loved it. I got my SUn roof, the kids got their dvd player. I got a NPS and I like the fact that I can hide themiddle seat in the second role. So none of my three kids have to sit next to each other, but I have the option for an extra seat if I need the cargo in the back. The only thing I wish the Odyssey has was a gas mileage gauge, like on other vans and SUV, and an exterior temp guage in the van, amd I wish it had daytime running lights. But I love it and the fact that with the internet special discount, I got it for 12000 less than the Outlook.",

The salesman was extremely helpful with giving me information and that is another part of why I bought my van where I did, at Bobby Rahal in Pa.

I didn't want to go into a large SUV, for one, the gas mileage, and two, some of them feel like I'm driving a large bus.",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"I considered getting a Saturn Outlook, which I liked, but had some reservations. I wanted a sun roof, the kids wanted a DVD player. In the Outlook, I could only get one of the other and pay like 40000. Then a friend of ours got one, so I got to see one up close. I loved the back windows roll up and down, and howt he seats in the back pull down. So I went and drove one. And I loved it. The kids loved it. I got my SUn roof, the kids got their dvd player. I got a NPS and I like the fact that I can hide themiddle seat in the second role. So none of my three kids have to sit next to each other, but I have the option for an extra seat if I need the cargo in the back. The only thing I wish the Odyssey has was a gas mileage gauge, like on other vans and SUV, and an exterior temp guage in the van, amd I wish it had daytime running lights. But I love it and the fact that with the internet special discount, I got it for 12000 less than the Outlook.",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"We love our new odyssey, we got it with a GPS tracking system and a DVD player, with many more features. It drives very smoothly, and it has lots of safety features. We give it a BIG thumbs UP!",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"I have only had my Odyssey for a week but it is by far the best auto purchase I have ever made!! It drives and rides like a dream. I did not get all extras but I didnt need them, I am not one for leather but still this is a very classy ride. Everyone who rides with me tells me how comfortable it is. The salesman was extremely helpful with giving me information and that is another part of why I bought my van where I did, at Bobby Rahal in Pa. I will update my review when I have had my van longer but I was just SO HAPPY with it I had to tell someone else who may be thinking about buying the same van.",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"I have been one of those moms who has dreaded buying the ""mommy van"". What took me so long!?! I had a CRV, which I loved but it just wasn't big enough for a family with two boys. I finally broke down and said I had to get a mini van. After researching online and through dealerships I knew I would settle for nothing but the Odyssey. The best decision I ever made on a car! I feel like I am driving from my favorite chair. It handles like a much smaller vehicle, but the room for everything is amazing. I LOVE MY MINIVAN!!! After driving it for three months, I don't want to drive anything else. Storage is excellant, seating is incredible. I can't find anything negative to say!",
2008,Honda,Odyssey,"After owning an Accord that we loved , we wanted more room for the grandkids. We put 5500 miles on one trip this summer and we could not have had a better vehicle for this trip. Plenty of room for luggage and all the things that were aquired on the trip. Twenty five and a half MPG for the highway driving.Plenty of room for the kids and grandkids,they really liked the east of getting in and out ot the third row seats. Grandpa loves the GPS Nav system. The only thing I would have done different,I would have purchased the Touring version.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"This car has been BIG problem since day 1. Brakes,A/C smells BAD!!!! engine managment system SUCKS.. you feel it everytime it goes from 3 to 4 t 6 cyls. the only way to drive the car is with the speedcontrol ON, if not the car jerks and feels like it has NO power and cant decide what gear it wants to be in, after takening back to the dealer(COLONIAL HONDA) just south of richmond ,va. they said nothing was wrong, then the manager told us yes there have been some reports of this issue with the odyssey and the accord but honda was doing nothing about it. HONDA SUCKS...they did fix the brakes with a tech notes, 2 days after we got it home from that trip to the dealer the a/c started to smell like bad fish or something, our car had 800 miles on it when we got it must have been a demo,was driven from NC. from the GPS anyhow. I will never buy a honda again and i will tell everyone how bad that dealer sucks also they tell you anything to get u to buy it but time to pay up they look at you like your telling a story.they told us we were to get 1st oil change free, but said they never told us that when we showed up to get oil changed and wanted to charge us 35.00, its sad that colonial honda of richmond has to sink so low to sell cars like this and then offer NO help to their car buyers when they have issues. buyers BEWARE of this dealer think before you buy from them.stay away from 2009 accords with cyl.mang.systems they dont work very well and you will not get any help if you have issues with it after you get it home.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"I drove my 2000 Odyssey 140,000 miles without a single maintenance problem. Bought a 2009 EX-L and just love it. Many improvements over the years have made it a better vehicle.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"I bought the 2009 Odyssey EX-L I have 5 kids not little, we love the confort of the van. All that crap about road noise is BS and one person complain about the radio, all cars have problems of station fluctuation use the 6 disc cd player (which the others don't have) and keep it moveing.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"I love my Honda Odyssey. I drove my 2004 for 100K miles, and got a great deal to trade up to the 2009. The Odyssey is well equipped, logically organized and drives like a much smaller vehicle. I have found that it is one of the few minivans that is actually fun to drive. We can load up the entire family on the weekend and go. Gas mileage is very good for the size and everything works the way it should. Only feature that could improve would be having real time traffic embedded in the navigation system.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"I drove a 2006 Odyssey 85,000 miles and really enjoyed the van on long and short trips. Now I have the 2009 Odyssey, I find it even rides better and the road noise has been reduced. Gas mileage and repair record has been great.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,Honda should be ashamed for building this junk. Problem after problems. I want my money back. I will never buy there product again.,
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"Honda Odyssey should be called the ""ODD"" ""DA"" ""SEA"". I would never purchase another one. I will go back to the Chrysler Van who know how to design a Mini-Van. A midget must of desined the inside of the Honda. Seats are as hard as a rock and very uncomfortable. I am getting brake squeaks already and the dealer won't do anything about it and tells me it will go away. I also am getting a lot of road noise. It is not what they claim it to be. Check out other Mini-Vans first before you buy a Honda.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,Advise - Please due your research before purchasing.,
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"Just bought a new Odyssey and love it. Took a family trip and everyone was happy! Husband in third row with his computer, boys in middle row watching a DVD and I had the front and could listen to my music. LOVE IT! Test drove others and found the Honda to be the most comfortable and quietest.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,"I hate the Honda Odyssey. I would never, ever buy another one. The cabin features are inconvenient to use, yes all the bells and whistles are there but they are placed in such an odd way, it is annoying. The road noise is so loud, the radio that comes with the van can pick up only the very closest stations, the seats are hard as rocks, and the passenger seat does not have the same comfy features as the driver seat. Just awful. Next van will be a Toyota which is what I should have waited for, none available when I wanted to purchase. That fact should have tipped me off.
 Stay away from this van unless you want to feel like you are camping every single time you get into it.",
2009,Honda,Odyssey,I have the Honda Odyssey EX-L and love it. I also found the secret to better gas mileage. In town I consistantly get 18 mpg but on the highway I can get up to 27 mpg if I keep it at 65 mph on cruise control.,
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Overall a very good car, drives very well, but overpriced and not great gas mileage",
2007,Honda,Pilot,Back row is not for someone with long legs which makes it uncomfortable on a long trip.,
2007,Honda,Pilot,"I have owned big three SUVs, and the Pilot, by far, is the best in quality of workmanship and dependability. However, the best part is the resale value after five years. Check for yourself, take a test drive and you won't be disappointed!",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"I purchased my Pilot in July and I have to say its been one of the best automobile purchases yet. I went from an 2005 Accord to my first SUV and not only does it have all the bells and whistles, but an amazing ride and excellent crash safety rating. Lots of space and decent gas mileage for its size.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"This is the best vehicle i have ever driven. It handles the road like a dream, is comfortable, driver friendly, and is as fun as a SUV can be.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,The back up camera ROCKS!!!,
2007,Honda,Pilot,"I owned a Mercury Mountaineer before my Pilot and liked it a lot. I am very happy with my new car (Pilot) and have nothing negative to say about it. It is comfortable, safe, has a great navigation system and is overall a very reliable vehicle. It lacks two things the Mountaineer had, keyless entry and a standard rear sensor warning. The trade-off is that the Honda was about $5000 cheaper than the Mercury. Only drawback to the Pilot is that it is somewhat ugly!!",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Our first Pilot was a 2004. My husband was hit and ended up totaling it when it was 2 years old. He walked away from the accident with what could be considered minor injuries. The car rolled and the driver's area was the one side that had no damage to it. So... we went out and got the exact same car-- only the 2006. It is now my car ( finally got rid of the minivan) and I really really like it. Love the DVD system- the 2006 is better than the 2004 system- bigger screen. The XM radio is a nice touch, along with the compass and 6 CD player. Added in 2005 was the sunroof- which is also a favorite of mine. What would I do to improve the car- not much. But I would like to see Honda put the nav system and the rear entertainment system in the same car. I would like to see day time running lights or automatic lights on the car- big safety feature. I miss the automatic locking doors- another safety feature liked especially by women. Also a jack for an IPOD would be nice to have- though reading the paperwork, I can remove the radio and attach a cable to run my IPOD. This car's improve safety features include the stablizer system and the side curtain airbags- a new feature for the 2006 vs the 2004. I plan to keep this car for quite some time--- unless Honda takes me up on my wish list and adds all the items I listed. I enjoy driving this car and judging from the amount of Honda Pilots I see in the school lots- so do all the other Moms in my neighborhood. But I will say this--- We can not fit 8 people in this car--- 4 of 6 of us are over 5 foot 9--- especially when kids are still in booster seats. When the little guys are bigger- will we be able to fit 3 comfortably across the back? Doubtful. But I love my car!!!!",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"every tall person in the world should buy this vehicle..it has nearly 2"" more headroom than its closest competitors.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"with the windshields becoming more horizontal because of gvt. fuel standards, head room has disappeared.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"in additon, the view out of the windshield is vastly superior to any other vehicle.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,i had to drive a 1993 caddy forever because of the interior room..those days are over.,
2007,Honda,Pilot,thank you honda..dont change a thing..,
2007,Honda,Pilot,"I traded my 2004 CR-V for the Pilot mainly to get the increased passenger space. I have three children who had grown since I bought the CR-V and they all play sports, so there's a lot to haul too. I commute ~45 minutes each way 3-4 days a week for work, so I spend a lot of time in the car. This Pilot is hands-down the best car I have ever owned! I would definitely buy one again, in a minute. I bought it on the last business day of 2006, so the dealership was motivated and I got a great deal. Seriously, I have had this car for 9 months now, and I haven't had a single complaint. It's comfortable, roomy, and not as bulky as the larger SUVs (like Suburbans) to drive. I can't say enough about my Pilot!",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"We bought our Pilot mostly for our role as grandparents. It holds 8 people if the three in the back row seat are under 5 feet tall. I drive it 185 miles every Wednesday for a day with the grandkids. It hauls soccer teams; it goes to piano lessons, to the swimming pool with the neighbor kids, etc. With the seats folded down, it picks up calf feed at the farmer's cooperative. It hauls our ski boat. The luggage rack with the added cross bars holds a pile of luggage when we took a trip with the car full of people. We've named her ""Beulah"" because she is such a work horse. We are comforted by its safety rating. One suggestion: better air conditioning for the far rear seat. When we want quiet, luxury, and romance, we drive our Cadillac.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Everything about this vehicle is a ""10"" with the exception of road noise. This vehicle's ride, fit and finish, reliability are superb. The extreme road noise needs to be addressed and fixed by Honda. Consumer Reports noted the same issue in their report on the vehicle.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"After having our second child my wife and I decided to trade in the Saab for a second SUV. We evaluated and test drove all of the luxury SUVs on the market and decided to purchase the Pilot. It offers the luxury, ride and fit of the luxury SUVs without the luxury price tag. We purchased our EXL from a Boston based dealership for $28,500 - over $10,000 less than the lower priced luxury vehicles (such as the Volvo).",
2007,Honda,Pilot,We couldn't be happier with our purchase!,
2007,Honda,Pilot,"We bought our Pilot in December 2006 after reading the crash test reviews. As grandparents, we were after one of the safest cars on the road. We couldn't be happier with this car. It carries all the car seats we need to carry plus assorted child gear. Drives like a dream. Sure, we love better mileage, but EVERYTHING else about the car can't be beat. The backup camera is awesome.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"A fantastic ride. The Vehicle Stability Assist and full time 4wd make for a very safe trip. In Montana, the roads can be very bad in the winter. I test drove it in February on a day when 4 inches were already on the ground. I couldn't even tell I was driving on snow. I had never felt that safe and secure operating a vehicle in the snow before. Anyone who decides to purchase the Pilot will be making a decision they will never regret.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Versatile, comfortable. Excellent vehicle. Gas mileage is lower than stated - getting 15-17 suburbs driving. Otherwise, completely satisfied.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Beautiful, Comfortable, and Strong large family vehicle with lot of leg space and safety with very good ground clearance. Far better than a van in most aspects. It has got a masculine look than a van, which is neither masculine nor feminine.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Reliable, Fun, Comfortable, Roomy, Good on Gas, Powerful, it is an all around well made family vehicle. We loved our 2006 Pilot soo much that we bought a 2007 Pilot also.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,"Traded my wife's 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited for the Pilot. Very difficult to get her out of the old Jeep. Pilot not quite as luxurious but expecting better dependability and economy. She misses the power passenger seat, dual climate controls and auto locks. Otherwise, we are very happy. Mileage is significantly improved and we are still fairly new so we know it will only get better. Planned to wait on the new Toyota Highlander but feel like we made a good choice due to the heavy discount available which got us to trade now and not later. Salesman and dealership were supurb (Sherwood Honda, Delray Beach, FL - Chris Bitzer). We really like the eight seat capacity. We are in FL and meet a lot of people at the airport so this feature will come in handy. No regrets.",
2007,Honda,Pilot,this is a fun car ... GET OUT OF THE WAY!,
2008,Honda,Pilot,"I traded in my 2004 honda odyssey for the 2008 pilot,man do i miss my van,but that van could not take a bump in the road ,now the pilot has poor volume on the radio,and if you drop something between the center console and the seats up front kiss it good-bye,i'm still tryin to get my dog-gone cell phone!I wish i waited for the 2009,this car is not good for long trips if your sitting in the seats behind the two front seats,not enuff cushion on seats,but real good on gas!good power!,I am turning 50 this year,and I will be getting the MDX!",
2008,Honda,Pilot,"I purchased my 08 Pilot on Feb. 19, 08. I just traded it on the 09 Pilot on August 13, 08. I wanted the 09 after seeing it on the MSN site. It was still a prototype at the time. So, I purchased the 08. I wished that I had waited. The 08 was fun and drove really well. It sat too low for carring two adults and three kids when loaded with a cooler rack attached to the trailer hitch. It did have five major flaws for me. The major one was that the rear glass on the lift gate didn't open. I didn't check this feature out and discovered it the day I went to put my Sunday papers for delivery in the back. The other problem is the placement of the gear shifter. Most times I'm turning on the window wipers instead. The 08 had room but still could have had moore.The 09 has lots more room in length and width. The head lights at night cut the top of the tree line off so you have to turn the brights on. The 09 is much better in those five areas. I wished that I had been in such a hurry to get the 08, then my payments on the 09 would be so much more......but I think it's been worth it buying the 09. For those of you that like the 03 - 08 pilots. You haven't seen anything until you drive and look at the 09. The suspension is so much better for hauling. The ride is terrific and the styling is too inside and out. Someone has listed that the 08 has a varible cylinger engine which isn't true. The 09 is the only Pilot that has this type engine that switches between 3, 4, and 6 cylinders. Please don't get me wrong. The 08 was a nice car but the styling and change in the horse power is very different.",
2008,Honda,Pilot,"I looked for over a year before I decided on the Pilot. I'm very satified with my final choice. It rides very smooth. It handles like a car not a truck. I love that it has seating for 8.Over all it's a great quality vehicle. It has 2 design flaws in my opinion. The location of where you turn the windshield wipers on,is in front of the gear shift. I have accidently turned my wipers on numerous times rather than putting the vehicle in gear. The other problem is,during daylight it's hard to see what's on the screen when your backing up. the screen should be adjustable so you don't get a glare. The vehicle is full of bells and whistles. It talks to you, and will do what you ask on proper command. (my kids love that)It's a little higher priced than the other vehicles in it's class, but I was willing to spend a little extra for saftey,quality and comfort.I would highly recommend putting this vehicle on your list to check out.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"Hate the interior. I didn't like it when I bought it and I hate it even more now that I have it. Can't stand leather, so I settled for this gosh awful cloth. The side panels on the inside of the doors are cloth too. Who's brilliant idea was this? Couple of times getting in the vehicle with it raining and now their stained with water marks. I believe they could've thought this through a lot better. I had a 2005 Pilot and I loved it so much more. Sorry I didn't keep it instead!",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"Bought an EX-L 4X4 with the bells and whistles and absolutely love it. It rides like a car and you can't beat the roominess and comfort. Heated leather seats, back-up camera, 3rd row seating, moonroof, and towing package were all included. Looked at the Toyota Highlander, which was nice, but every option was extra. Pilot beats it for comfort and ride too for far less money. My neighbor had been looking at the MDX and other ""luxury"" SUV's, that would've cost him 43,000 or more, but after sitting and riding in my Pilot, he said, ""it's a steal for the money."" Now he's considering getting one himself. Get one, you'll love it!",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"I have a 2003 Honda Pilot EX-L with only 100,000 miles on it. In order to become an all-wheel drive family, I traded in the 98 Honda Accord with just 188,000 miles on it which my son drives and handed down the 03 Pilot. I love the upgrades - heated seats, heated side view mirrors, moonroof, backup camera (which appears in the rear-view mirror, allowing your eyes to remain on the mirror instead of glancing to another screen), and a stainless steel dual exhaust. In addition, there is a instantaneous and average MPG display by the odometer. Since I live in a mountainous area, I am only able to attain the gasoline mileage ratings where the land is flat. Nonetheless, the 09 is a great vehicle and I am very pleased with my new ride.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"I've had my 2009 Pilot for 4 months and so far I really like it. Originally, I wasn't crazy about the exterior design, but I've gotten used to it. The interior, however, is really great. There is so much room and it is a really comfortable ride. The back rows/cargo area is extremely flexible and well designed. Easy to find a configuration you need. Lots of storage. If I were to make one suggestion, Honda should upgrade the transmission to a 6 speed automatic. It tends to whine a bit at 70 MPH and could use an extra gear. Gas mileage is a bit better than advertised, but not much.
 
 I took a chance when I purchased this and I have been pleasantly surprised.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"Just bought the 2009 after owning a 2006 Pilot. Great upgrades although I miss some features. However, I understand the change. For example, I have twin preschoolers. In order to widen the interior, the edge where you ""step up"" has narrowed, making it difficult for my girls to climb in. On the other hand, it's easier to fold down the middle row with their car seats in place. Before, I had to puch the car seats over all the time in order to get to the 3rd row. To create more rear cargo and head-room, the exterior rear shape changes making it look ""boxier"" - very Hummerish. And lastly, my 2006 had a rear entertainment system. I chose not to get it this time but, in doing so, I lost the 110v eletric outlet that I loved in order to charge my PDA, plug in my car vacuum, etc. But those are small changes that I can live with. The upgrades, quality, safety, etc. outweigh those.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"Just purchased the 2009 Honda Pilot after spending months reviewing and test driving other SUV's including the 2008 Pilot. The 2009 Pilot is awesome! It has every feature that you could possibly want or need in a vehicle. It has an incredible quiet and comfortable ride, and gives you the feeling that your family is safe and secure within. Turning is tight and it hugs the road securely. It's actually a little higher than the 2008 Pilot, and you feel that you are in command while sitting in the driver's seat. Blind spota are very minimal with the large side mirrors and the reverse sensing system. Money wise, it's an excellent buy when you add up individually all the features that are included.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"Just got rid of my Volvo XC 90 which I hated. Always had problems with it. Bought the 2009 Pilot Touring model. Wow, what a great vehicle. The comfort, the ride, excellent. Everything is easily accessible and the mileage isn't bad either.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"I had a 2008 Honda Pilot. I ******* by a Suburban going 50 mph. It flipped my 2008 Pilot but I was physically is good shape. The police said I was very lucky since many flipps the people are killed, paralyzed, or missing a limb. I am in good shape!
 So I contribute its safety a major factor. You only get one chance and you can be the best driver, but if someone hits you, it can mean the difference between life and death. I purchased this 2009 Honda Pilot. I love it! Great style and commands attention wherever I go. Good gas mileage, lots of storage space, seats 8, best looking SUV...stylish without beling pretentous. I love this vehicle!",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"I purchased a 08 Pilot on February 19,08. I liked the car. I traded a 2004 Yukon XL on it. I purchased the SE model which is now the EX. I traded my GMC because of payments and no warranty.....plus I have always like the styling and the reputation of a Honda vehicle. The reason that I traded my 08 Pilot for the 09 is because of the extras it has vs the 08 Pilot. The gas milage isn't the factor because they on differ one mile more in the city and two miles more on the hwy. The o8 Pilot lift gate glass didn't open....i deliver newspapers and it made it difficult to load them. I wanted this vehicle when I saw it on MSN as a proto type. So, i settled for the 08. Go compare these two vehicles at a dealer. You'll be very surprised at the differences. My husband is 5'9 and didn't have the leg room comfortable for him. The 09 has plenty and he's happy. Plus the second row has more leg room as well as behind the third row seat. I delivered my papers this past sunday and had lots more room. The 08 would have been cramped. I don't like the placement of the gear shift. The sun roof is wider than the 08. I can actually feel the air now. It sits ups higher too. We have used all of our suv's on the beach in Hatteras,NC to drive on the beach. The 08 didn't come with a trailer hitch and the 09 does. The 08 Pilot with a cooler rack attached sat a foot from the ground. I can see even without trying the cooler rack on the 09 that it will not be a problem since the 09 is on 17 inch tires and the suspension package is alot better than the 08. The 09 has lots of power too. The styling of the interior is fantastic. It ticked my off about the 08, if you dropped anything between those seats you almost had to say good by to it.... no space between the seats and now the 09 has room under the front passenger and drivers seats if you want to place a small purse. This vehical also has air condition vents in third row. I luv the 09 Pilot.",
2009,Honda,Pilot,"I bought a new Pilot a few months ago, the ride and power and comfort is fantastic. Being handycapped I need a lot of room and having 2 grandchildren with carseats, room is essensial. I feel safe in a big car and the added 4 wheel drive is a bonus for bad weather and driving on the beach. Short trips to the store are gas guzzler but long trips the milage is desent. Happy Honda made a bigger veichle, And being 60 and driving a sporty car makes me feel good.",
2007,Honda,Element,Our Honda we bought used 07 in 08 with 5400 miles and my wife and I are very happy . This may not be the car for everyone but gas mileage 24 to 25 miles per gallon ok power easy care. So you might want to take alook at the Element!!!!!,
2007,Honda,Element,"I bought this car after driving all types of cars as I own an auto repair shop in Malibu, CA.this car is built in the USA and 70% of the parts are built here Its a true American car, un-like most so called american cars that are really built in Mexico or Canada or some other country, look on your door tag you may be superized! Its so comfortable to get in and out of and I am sure it may have saved my life twice,due to the stability control,the SC has way more lip stick and roushe I don't now how to spell that word sorry,I came out of beautiful 86, F-350 4x4 turbo custom diesel truck, I still have it, I have not needed the truck this car hauls all I have needed lately. Great Car Love it look forward to driving it every night when I go home. It also has XM radio and a nice bumper sudwoofer sound system. Hope it helps in your car purchase, if not get a Ford There really great to. accept the new diesel its not good after 140,000 miles most people buy a diesel to last a long time these don,t.Also please don,t buy a German car these cars have major problems in the elecrical systems NOT KIDDING! Thank you for reading my review Kelly",
2007,Honda,Element,"This is the best car I've ever owed, I'm 6'4"" and it has all the headroom of a Rover, I call it my little Rover for 40K less, the dogs love it.",
2007,Honda,Element,"I just purchased my 2007 Element 4wd. The gass mileage is great for an SUV, and I like the roominess of the vehicle. I purchased it specifically because I would have 2 kids going off to school within the next 2 years, and needed a vehicle that I could load them up and move them, with relative ease. The Element is so versatile with its seating options.",
2008,Honda,Element,"I have owned my 2008 Honda Element EX AWD for 12 months and have 13,000 miles on it. During that time and have not had one problem with it. I'm 6'3"", 290 lbs. and am very comfortable. The AWD is excellent for light off-road travel. Great stereo! It's the most vehicle for the least money. I'm a retired police officer and still very active with fishing, traveling, etc. I love my Honda!",
2008,Honda,Element,"I have 38000 miles on the SC and plan on many more.
 Would like to see the SC with an optional larger engine as I tow a small trailer.AWD on the SC would be great for the north.Best little all around car especially for the money.",
2008,Honda,Element,"Here's the real deal on the SC.
 Good: The replacement for the 1967 Chevy Van. Engine power. Handling. Access (In open space). Controls. Amazing amount of interior space (Seats 4 comfortably). Lots of storage space up front. Utility (Rear seats can be removed, 50/50 split, turned upright, layed flat to create a bead of sorts, to create a wide path for hauling). Stereo is very good. Seating position (For most people). Turning radius. Safety. Lots of accessories available (Check on line first before you go to your local dealer). Solid build quality It's a Honda made in USA. 
 
 Bad: Visibility in certain situations (Parallel parking)and you gotta look at least twice before changing lanes there is a blind spot at rear pillar. Suspension is very tight (You'll feel the bumps. Can be punishing on very bumpy roads). Road noise is pronounced especially at highway speed. Gas mileage about 17-22 mpg (give or take). Tough to open and access side rear doors if in a parking spot close to other vehicles. 
 
 Advice: Have the driver/passenger side windows lightly tinted it'll help keep you and the vehicle much cooler. Get a leather steering wheel cover, much better grip. If you carry stuff in the rear it will move around when you hit bumps. Find a way to secure it.
 
 The Skinny: I'm sure I missed some things. You like the looks or not. If you do, you'll get used to the quirks. To me, it is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. For it's application look no further.",
2008,Honda,Element,"I get 23-30 mpg, depending on where I drive, which is way better than I expected. I drive the kids to school in it, I've camped in it, I haul stuff in it. I'm a very eclectic person with many hobbies- art, photography, fishing, hiking, camping, travel, etc. The Element is great for all my hobbies- it has enough room to haul any equipment I need, it's SUV-ish enough to go offroad without getting stuck, it gets great gas mileage. I LOVE IT!!!!
 Oh, by the way, this is car I learned to drive in (I know, I'm 20-something and just got my license). I find it really easy to drive, and it has a tight turn radius so it's super easy to park at grocery stores etc., and despite it's size,it's very easy to see everything around the car.
 And despite being from a foreign auto-maker, My element was actually assembled in Ohio in West Liberty- a factory that has in the past hired my husbands Union sheetmetal company to do a lot of work. I looked at a Chevy at one point, and it was assembled in Mexico- how's that for 'The heartbeat of America'?",
2008,Honda,Element,"I have an SC edition. It runs great. We haven't had to use the waranty once as no repairs have been necessary. The sterio in the SC is pumpin and it handles great. The only negative is that the ride can be pretty bumpy. Don't know if the suspension on the other models is the same, ******** pretty stiff on the SC. If you're in the back seat you will feel every little dent in the road.",
2008,Honda,Element,I absolutely enjoy and appreciate my wonderful vehicle! It's the best. I would recommend this truck for ANYONE. It's also terrific on gas. Hondas are awesome!,
2008,Honda,Element,"Handles great! Not to fast, but peppy enough. This is our 2ND Element! Would definately recommend it.",
2009,Honda,Element,ive driven a few cars around and i have to say my element is the best car/suv/truck ive ever driven.  i bought one (a 2009) that was traded in with 9000 miles on it this weekend and never before have i felt so safe in a car.  i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes outdoor excursions.  its almost like a mini truck when the back seats are put up.  very smooth and powerful.  it has a lot of room without being too big.  turns extremely well can stop on a dime and is very stable.  my only complaint is if you have bad posture driving for a few hours can get uncomfortable.,
2009,Honda,Element,"I bought this SUV for my wife, trying to please her, she loved her Jeep Grand Cherokee but had to have this. Now we traded it in after 9,000 miles took a horrible hit on the resale. What a horrible car. It has no power, no comfort. Nothing positive other than the fact that I no longer own it. Do not buy this car, no matter how good the deal.  We will stick with the Jeep from now on. What a mistake.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"I traded a 2007 Cadillac CTS for it and have not even missed it. I had the dealer install running boards,bush wacker,trailer hitch, rear flaps and bug shield. It looks and handles great. The best pick up I have ever owned. I should say car, because it handles like one. The 4 x 4 is a great standard addition.
 I could go on and on, but there are only a few hundred characters left.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,After owning & driving a Ridgeline no other truck or car will ever do it for me.Honda does it again.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"I am self-employed and have had my Ridgeline for a little over 2 years. For the past year or so I started using my Ridgeline as my business truck. It has worked out like a charm. I have a courier service here in Hawaii and it has been the almost perfect vehicle for the job. I say 'almost' because the 2 negatives are gas mileage (about 16 to 17 mpg) and don't go over the 1500 lb payload! Otherwise it has been a wonderful vehicle to use in my business. It is a very comfortable truck, it's also a very smooth riding truck (compared to my son's new F-150, it's like riding in a MDZ S class!)and very quiet. The bed has been big enough to take a standard 48"" by 40"" pallet and plenty enough space in the back seat (with seats up) for my deliveries. The under-the bed trunk is also very useful. Power is more than enough and the engine sounds good when you have to floor it. Reliability has been outstanding! So if you need a good run-about truck, check out the Honda Ridgeline!",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,We love this truck - it's the first truck I've ever driven and it's stylish and really comfortable. It rides and handles like a much more expensive vehicle. We are planning to get another one at the end of our lease - this time a purchase.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,The truck that drives like a car. Rear truck below the bed is awesome. Very comfortable and reliable.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,I love my honda ridgeline. We are both tall people and this truck is just what we needed. We can carry a lot in the trunk that is a plus. We have only one thing we wish was better that is the gas mileage. Overall we are very satisfy.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"Best performance, technology, quality and value of any competitive truck. These are used by Blackwater in Iraq where they are preferred. The Ridgeline is impressive looking, great on gas, rides like a car and will stick to the roads in both icey and snow covered roads. Quality is impressive.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"I traded my 2006 Cadillac CTS for my 2007 Ridgeline and have never been happier. It is more comfortable and has a smoother ride, more power and I recorded 26 MPG on my last trip. I get looks of approval whereever I drive it. Never will I be ""Cadillac Charlie"" again.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"I bought this vehicle while shopping for a pickup truck. I have owned trucks in the past and was always unhappy with the ride quality as a daily use vehicle Not so in the Ridgeline. It doesn't even feel like a truck. The ride is great and the features are better than any other truck on the market. A standard bed liner and trunk, a pivotable tailgate, as well as two rear foldup seats are some of my favorite features. The optional navigation system is easily the best I have seen out there.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"There are more powerful and better off-road performing trucks out there but none with the reliability of a Honda. The only cons I have are the styling is a bit goofy (the front comes too mind) and the gas mileage seems a bit overstated in my experience. I have yet to get close to 20 MPG even on a highway only road trip. More like 17 at best and 14 in the city. I've never owned a vehicle that got the stated MPG though. The turning radius also seems a bit large, but it is a mid-size truck.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,Overall a great vehicle that I love to drive.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,My reccomendation is to get the nav and the XM it is worth the extra dough.,
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"This truck is a great balance between a crossover and a truck. It accomplishes everything a crossover or minivan can do yet also has truck abilities. This vehicle will never sell to a hardcore truck fan, but thats not its goal. It rides like a car and gives you plenty of cargo and passenger room. The layout in the cabin is great. This vehicle excells at being the weekend errand choice. It will haul plenty of things from home depot or a gardening center. If your an outdoorsy type you can load up your mountain bikes or kayaks and head out. This vehicle is just a pleasure to own. I needed a vehicle that wasn't a car but didn't want to have to rough it with a ladder on frame truck either. This is the balance I needed. The in bed trunk is the best thing since sliced bread. Rear seats fold up easily with the pull of a handle and return to the down position the same way. Loads of head room and leg room. Gas is decent considering all that is relative. Mixed driving usually produces 20 mpg.",
2007,Honda,Ridgeline,"i never would have guessed in a million years that i would have bought a honda truck. im a chevy man. best ride,more fun and now a truck that you can store stuff in the trunk. this is the most fun i have ever had driving a truck. thanks honda.",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,Great Truck. The truck is very smooth on the highway and the body style is very nice.,
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"I would never buy another one. Issues with the brakes over and over and neither the dealership nor Honda Corp will repair, and say they don't know how. Maybe it is fixed, maybe not. Not looking forward to getting stranded and having to be towed in again. Also, the air conditioner makes a horrible noise - sounds like an animal growling. Seals are bad, even when I first purchased the vehicle. Back tailgate gets stuck when trying to open. Very expensive vehicle to have this many problems and the dealership unable to figure out how to repair. Honda Corp is unprofessional in their dealings and customer service and no calls back from either to assist the owner. Once the vehicle is sold, you are on your own. With this many problems, the vehicle is not worth the price.",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"Because I didn't need a big truck anymore, I traded in a 2004 F-150, for a 2008 Ridgeline. 
 Since I retired, my payload consists of a few things from Loews, or Home Depot, not tools and ladders.
 My Ridgeline is fine, with lot's of room in the cab for the grandkids.
 The mileage could be better, my worst was 16 MPG, and my best was 20 MPG. (My Ford 150 v-8 got that)
 I like the maintenance reminder. 
 I've had it serviced four times, at the dealership where I bought it. They're fast, and inexpensive(Less that $60 each time), and they do good work. 
 (I couldn't get my Ford serviced for less the $100 any time I went to the dealership.) 
 The ride is really noisy, and ROUGH ! 
 You feel and hear, every seam and crack in the road.
 The enviromental system (AC and heat) works great, but the digital controls are hard to see, difficult to read.
 The options that came with the truck, at the time I bought it, was limited, however, everything I wanted (and needed) was available after market (for BIG $$$ !)
 I would like to have the Auto Headlights, the Daylight lights, the Auto Rearview Mirror, and the Coded Door Lock system. I was told these options are not available for any Honda. (The Mirror is available, but cost's almost $500 installed)
 All in all I like my Ridge just fine.",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"I love truck. I went from a dodge to this and there is no comparison. I live on a farm and do a lot of hauling and live on rough roads. This truck has held up wonderfully. I love it. It is a marriage of quality, style, and function. I also love the trunk in the bed.",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,This has been a great truck for my family. The truck size was just right for what we do around the house. I traded in a 2006 Toyota Tundra for it. I just wanted to downsize to a smaller truck that would have room for my family. We drove from Ohio to Fla.(18Hrs) with a family of 4 and there was plenty of room for everyone.,
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"I am really happy with my purchase of a 2008 Ridgeline. I got a great deal, and exactly what I was looking for. Rides and drives great, in bed storage is perfect for all my boating stuff, lots of neat design features. The size is great for what I need a truck for. I have the RTL, leather, sunroof, 6 disc, everything but Navigation (I already have a portable unit.)
 The seats are great, this is a very comfortable truck. Power sliding back glass! Fold UP rear seats. All major ergonimic functions are designed to be able to be done with gloves on (did you notice?). How cool is this: Giant grab handles to close the door, big knob for the headlights, big knob for volume control on sound system, big column shifter. All much easier to use with gloves on.
 
 The things I would like to see in this truck: 25-35 more hp (rated at 247 hp, not bad but Honda should be ahead of everyone), mileage computer (can't figure out why this isn't on there.), auto up/down passenger side window (driver's side has it, why not passenger?). Rear passenger compartment claims to hold a bicycle with the seats up, won't hold mine which is a simple standard moutain bike. 
 
  I can't comment on mileage yet (so far 16-17), as I have less than 3500 miles on mine, and it hasn't even had it's break-in oil changed yet (don't do this early, it is engineered to stay in a while to do something in the engine. Not sure what, but my salesman stressed that when I bought it.). Other say they get better mileage after 5-6 thousand miles.
 
 Rumor says honda will make a small V8 for this truck at about 4.5 liters making over 300 hp. Don't know about that, but I feel they can get more out of their V6, even if they have to punch it out to 4.0 liters like Nissan did. Considering this is Honda's first try at a truck, they thought outside the box, really hit a homerun with their innovative thinking in construction and features. It will only get better as we all know from watching Honda over the years. Goforit!",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,Where have you been. It my town I live at they never promote the Ridgeline. It is had so much room and good on the highway and get better mileage and also so ride so smooth. Thanks Honda for making the Ridgeline.,
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"I traded my 04 Tacoma in on an 08 Ridgeline and have not looked back! Rides like my old 72 Impala, goes off road, a huge locking trunk, dual swing tailgate, storage everywhere, decent MPG, Honda reliability, what more do you need?I heard VW is planning a competitor, VW don't waste your R&D $$ on a poor copy!This vehicle is the death of the SUV! Ford, GM, Chevy, Dodge, you missed the boat again!",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,i enjoy driving again.....had the truck 6 months and so happy i purchased it,
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,Very nice to drive. In bed trunk very nice & convenient. Comfortable interior.,
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"I bought a 2006 Honda Ridgeliner, and have been very happy with it. It rides with the comfort of a car, but also can go off road. The rear truck under the pickup bed is huge, and can almost accomodate anything. It even has a drain plug, if you want to fill it with ice. I now have 53,000 miles on my truck. The EPA averages have been very close to actual mileage, if you keep your foot off the accelerator. I get about 21 mpg at 65, about 20 at 70, and about 19 at 75. I also have a motorcycle trailer, and when towing, I just get about 13. I think the truck is just a little underpowered for being 4500 pounds. I'd buy a new one with a small V-8, and some additional HP and torque.",
2008,Honda,Ridgeline,"TRUCK IS AWESOME, GREAT FEATURES, QUALITY, FUN TO DRIVE, LOOKS SHARP",
