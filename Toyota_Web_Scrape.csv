2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Faithful   I bought this car used from the dealership and have basically been able to go anywhere I've wanted to. My corolla is good on gas has never overheated and handles well on the road. I will defiantly be looking for a Toyota the next time I'm out car shopping. They are great.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Reliable Car, A To B Without Issues And Cheap   Appearance: It looks good; it's not fancy but I think it is nice. Build quality: Road noise / Rain noise are noticeable, comfortable seats, solid car. Performance: Very good for a 1.8 L engine, gas mileage is great, I feel safe driving it."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Amazingly Reliable 2007 Toyota Corolla Le   Runs great! Brand new tires, battery, kept up on all maintenance. Been a great car and would be a very dependable and reliable car. Great for first drivers! The fuel economy is amazing. Gets around 35 MPG which is great!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"This Has Been A Great Car, Served Me Well   Overall the car is great, 1st car I have ever owned, If I had to continue driving a car, it would be this one. Kids are getting bigger so it is time for a larger vehicle, a truck. This will be a great car for anyone."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"A Vehicle That Will Take You Places Reliably.   This is not your fancy schancy ride. If you are a practical individual who is only looking for reliability, efficiency, longevity, and low cost maintenance in your desirable vehicle. This is one of those classification. Along with Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, Mitsubishi Lancer..etc. Not much elaboration, and if you hit it, it's not so painful, because the car is cost affordable to repair."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Very Reliable! Regular Maintenance Is All That Is Required (tires, Oil, Gas) Headache Free.   I like that this car is super reliable and never costs me money besides gas. I owned it 6 years and never had 1 issue. Better than Honda, Subaru, Ford combined. This is a super car. I love Toyota. I would highly recommend this car to anyone who wants reliable transportation."

2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Dependable but vanilla
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Power and fuel saving car are the best features. Body is too light for my taste. Its an inexpensive car.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Hard Drive in Freeways
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Reliable Car, A To B Without Issues And Cheap  "
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Overhyped Little Car.   Underpowered but it was a small car, but handled poorly, front seats were tight, unlike Nissan Sentra's more roomy front. Trunk and back seat were okay, with seats down was decent. Toyota took this car for granted not solid built and not fun to drive, too slow and could not push this. It was basic transportation at a higher price."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Family Car!!   Very reliable,affordable,not a lot of miles on the car,has some minor front end bodydamage to the left front but fixable,good condition besides the body damage on the front left end of the car. overall good car"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Good Safe Little Car.   I was Hit by Drunk Driver it did what it was supposed to do in a crash. The car was totaled and I replaced the car with a 2011 Corolla S. Good fuel milage Cheap to fill up and Maintain.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,The Best Reliable Car In The World   my car is the 1.8 litre version which has a very sudden acceleration. the brakes are powerful and it has a good ride handling.it has a very strong build and there are no squeaks or rattles. the exterior appearance is somewhat boring but it has a nice interior.mileage is not that good but it has a very low maintenance cost.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great First Car   It's Toyota, it's reliable, good value for first time buyers. It's great on fuel economy especially with unstable gas prices. Just wish it more horsepower and better radio head. No issues to report, it gets you from point A to B with no problem. You'll this car as much as I do."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Performance And Reliability Excellent But Comfort Not Satisfactory   Basically the pros and cons tell it all. I just wish there was some more leg room for the driver. Tall people get leg cramps after driving longer than 40 miles. Runs perfect, because of light body horsepower and engine has enough strength to accelerate rapidly. V6 and 200+ horsepower really not needed for such car since its small. 4 cylinder and 126 horsepower is more than enough for such light car."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Steady Does It   I would rather be driving a Honda, but for the price, I am quite satisfied with my Corolla. After a while, the seats get uncomfortable. The driving is steady, not zippy. It's a great choice for people on a budget."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Little Get Me There And Back Cheap Ride!   I sold the Fiero to get something that gets great gas mileage, and the Corolla does a great job at that! She is not as cool or as rare as the Fiero, but with gas prices still climbing, I don't care!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Wonderful Little Economical 4-door Small Sedan.   Wonderful little Japanese thingamajig. Gets 39-41 mpg average (even in the summer with the A/C cranked up). The worst mileage I've ever gotten was 33.2 mpg (IN 4TH GEAR!!!). Even without shifting into 5th, this car still gets better mileage than its lowest EPA estimate!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Gas mileage and cargo were as advertised but nothing else was.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Just not well built.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Its never given me any problems the last 5 years! but i have to move overseas and sell it
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Good basic transportation
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Needed Cruse Control
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"the ride quality, reliability and the low maintenance costs"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"absolutely loves this car, roomy interior, great gas mileage, sunroof!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"needs more horsepower, tight steering"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Excellent fuel economy, smooth and quiet ride. Extremely reliable, super cold air-conditioning."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Leg room is somewhat tight, Front seat can't go as back as you desire. A bit unsatisfied when you realize you have pushed back the seat as far as it goes, but its not enough. For very tall people, leg cramps can be the result. not roomy interior for the driver. Comfort wise its a C grade. But for small and short people, it should be very comfortable and roomy"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,The car is very reliable and requires little maintenance.ææ
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"The car is not very cool, and there is not a lot of room."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"I lyk its speed when um just left with 10 mins to reach my important place....the interior is good also, including my sound systems....I 've a nice exterior customization....the funny thing, the people just stare, so I love to park it."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"the body is not so stong, it gets smashed easily, when it collides, with my rivals..."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Gas Mileage!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"It can take 4 people with luggage, in comfort, distances of up to 500 miles without refueling."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"If you want torque below 2500 rpm, do not buy this car."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Decent   Good MPG, low power. interior is quite small and the sound system isnt very loud, the bass mostly, barely any ummph to it. only a hundred thirty eight horse power. very good reliable lasting vehicle for a moderate price range."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,All Waether   i love this car cause i good for any where you want to go. my dad brought me this car on my birthday and am happy to have this car on my own and i will never leave this car
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Great Car   it is has very powerfull engine it has gud acceleration nice car to drift gud handling big cabin inside we can say that it is gud car for single person and also for a family. i love my car so much.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great   Pretty good car, gets me from A to B. I was expecting less power then it had! The cost of gas is relatively low as it has very good MPG. The car is fairly fun to drive, the steering is nice and loose, so its easy to maneuver."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Gli Model's.   The 2007 Toyota Corolla is a vice-free economy car with lots of name cachet. Unfortunately, it costs too much and suffers from a bland personality. The Corolla's interior is furnished with high-quality materials and user-friendly controls that wouldn't seem out of place in a more expensive car. During highway driving, it's a quiet cruiser. This car is fun to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Its Ok To Get Me To School And Work   Its small, not very agile, and I can't take it in the mud. Its practical and doesn't stand out. It is tough to haul my mountain bike to the park. The engine sounds like a slight breeze. The styling is just ok. Gotta say I love the color though"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Take The Chance   really bad brakes, makes it difficult to handle at great spped esp in rushy places....handling is ok and accceleration is good..mileage ijust fine in city but good on highways and regarding maintenance, its economical as compared to new model."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Economy With Efficiency!   its fun to drive but some modification may be good to increase overall torque power. This car is also fuel efficient to the max. 17km/L!! Super good for long distance driving! Fixing some body kits may increase the appeal of the car!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good First Car.   it drives smooth, handles nice, quick response, good mileage. Just gets disaligned quickly, and eats up the tires quick, also shakey after you hit 70 mph, and verry light too. Good cargo space also. It's an overall good car. Fun drive, good first car."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Best Seller Is The Best   Mate the Overall Engineering is well upto the Mark making it the Best seller in the world. However it Lags behind the civic in terms of Looks. and Ergonomics. The New altis looks great though. This is a Solid Car.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good Car If You Can Avoid Curbs   Good fuel efficient car that still has decent room and isn't so boring. Has pretty good acceleration, brakes, and handling. I like the exterior look though the interior isn't anything special. Had a bad experience with repairs; slipped on some ice at a fairly low speed and the very minor impact with the wheel on the curb set it way out of alignment causing a very expensive and lengthy repair."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good   It has low acceleration, good brakes, hasnt needed severe repairs, interior is acceptable, it saves gas, not that fun to drive because of the 1 mm clutch, it is not really that good, but its acceptable I wouldn't buy another corolla"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla Le Doesnt Mean Low-esteem   performance- 1.8L of 87 octane burning fury, clutch reminds me of a wet rag stretched over a flywheel build quality-made in japan.....and korea.....and bangledesh........and kazachstan appearance-little old lady from pasadena ain't got nothin on me cost of ownership-very little, i hardly even change the oil in it fun factor-guarantee i am in the top ten percentile when it comes to the average rpm of your corolla"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla 2007   it is hoghly qualified,excellent performance with fantastic stability but the proplem may be in its shape,i think there are many cars better shape than it, ownership price is so good and suitable in comparison to other brand cars"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car.   The Corolla is an easy drive. It is also good on gas too, 1.3L, doesn't cost a lot to fill up, the most $40. Performance wise, it's fine, if you're looking for a powerful car, this isn't the car for you."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Must Have For Ones Loving Long Dirty Routes.   Accelaration is good, however braking required few alterations, appearance is decently well balanced both from inside and outs, Cost of ownership is also affordable, Its a normal experience to drive it no fun as such. It is reliable and cool."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Excellent Car, Could Just Use A Revamp In Appearance.   The acceleration is good, though a low top speed. Brakes work very well, better than most cars I've owned. Handling is what you would expect from a Toyota. The only repair so far that it has needed was an ECU change. Exterior styling leaves room to be desired as well and the interior, rather bland. It gets roughly 29/32 on the average day. The car is rather fun to drive, but it is most certainly not a sports car by any means."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Would Give It A 5 Star   I like it all even my subwoofers. It is a very good car for long traveling like to Miami,FL. I wish they would make the car just a little bit longer that is all. And a little bit more sporter with with a lot more hp."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Car   this car is great on gas, but it absoluetly sucks in the snow. it needs some good snow tires this coming year. My 2000 Buick lasabre was the best car for snow ever! the corolla is supposed to be pretty dependable so I bought one. kinda expensive though. and the toyota dealers are worms in disguise."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Amazing   I just got a 2007 Toyota Corolla S modle and I love it! has grate performance amzing acceleration and braking handles amazing No reapirs does not make noise fun to drive. insdide is sweet charlole and black love it out side is dark blue with a spoler cost of owner ship is 265 a month and 30 in town 41 hwy. This car is really fun to drive. I would recoomned this car to anyone because it is really nice and really fun to drive!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Rolla   This is my ZRE152 Toyota Corolla. It was purchased to compensate for my unreliable, not so compliant, fuel guzzling R32 GTR. It's a car that is convenient, reasonably fun to drive, fuel efficient and practical. The first week, I tested its fuel efficiency by driving it really slow and looking at how high my mileage can get up to. The 2nd week, I drove hard to see how low my mileage can go down to, and test its handling through corners and round-abouts. I was impressed by both. This is my first car that I cannot see the bonnet while sitting at the driver's seat, so I have to guess the distance from the wall to the bumper bar."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Toyota Corolla   The Transmission always shifts after 3 rpm, Its got lots of pep to it though and it's a very tight suspension, so you feel the road. Looks good, and has great stock sound system, is really good on gas too"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"???   I use my car mostly in work trips and thats why I choose Toyota. Its reliable and it has good space to drive my cleaning stuffs and other. Its safe it has ABS-brakes, airbacks and other else stuffs to safe driving. Its good car to drive. Tammerautos car service is great, never had problem whit them."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Corolla Altis (fun Or Funk)   I really loved when I give gas and lose anyone behind me or try to over take me. This machine has alot of potential but the body is too light for 1800cc. The seating capacity is good as well but I miss the magic of Honda Civic 05. Have Fun
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Mileage   Best gas mileage ever: 39 mpg hwy (MT), fast since you can shift whenevr you want and stretch the gears. WIth less than US$30 u fill the gas tank and it will last you a week. Easy to park too! Simple to deal with and cute in itself without any big deals."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla Speedway Blue   Performance - accerlation, braking, handling = GOOD Build Quality - never had a problem, but i hate the gas prices! Appearance - love the color ~ speedway blue (a signature for `07 Corolla models) rims will be upgraded in the future. Cost of Ownership - gas milage is 41, maintance = GOOD Fun Factor - fun to drive! :)"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,The Gas Saver   I really love this car 'coz this is really a gas saver as now the price of gasolne is going up every single day. Also it has a built-in 6-discs CD player when I bought it. The space of the car could fit for 5 adults for sure. Very nice one.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corrolla Not A Family Car   It's a peppy little car and it's good on gas.... Noisy when going above 85mph lol...... Interior is also noisy when hittting bumps. I bought this car for commuting for work; so, it's good for what I bought it for.... other then that I wouldn't buy it for a family car... The Montero covers that but I get maybe 12mpg....."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Toyota Corolla   Best luxury and affordability in its Class in Pakistan. Strong suspension and rugged for the roads of my country. with over 102 bhp and mileage of 15km/ltr.Beige color interior and Rose Metallic exterior.Good acceleration and handling but have some issues in braking but overall a nice car to drive.
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Girlfriend   Strong linear acceleration, nice to handle. It's build quality is bad, the metal feels lika sheet of paper. Rear seat is the best in it's class. Easy to maintain, good mileage (10 kmpl). The driver's seat is the best place to be. I would not recommend this car to a friend because it's outdated and the latest corolla looks better."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Cororra S   I got this car from my parents right before Christmas my senior year in high school, as a replacement to my 94 Camry we were selling due to minor ongoing maintenance issues. The ""Cororra"" is extremely fun to drive and, if I'm careful, I get about 37 mpg highway, and not much less in city. I only have 4 negligible complaints - the cover on the driver's side curtain airbag is ajar (should I be concerned?), the track and gears and whatnot in the moonroof are covered with globs of greasy white goo that gets in my hair if my windows are open when that is open, after only a couple months of my ownership, the little compartment in the center that flips outward stopped working right and it won't stay shut :(, and the car is highly susceptible to cross-winds. Other than that, beautiful car, I like the headlights :). I also like that the exhaust is hidden under the ground effects. Best Christmas present ever."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,The Best Car I Have Ever Owned   I like the car a lot it has more room than my previous cars and gets 41 miles to the gallon on the hwy. performance is not too bad i has good acceleration because its a manual if it was the auto it would not be as good the build quality is amazing i have been working on cars for 12 years and have not seen this good of quality from any other manufacture i choose the s for the sporty look with the body kit it is a fun car to drive and would highly recommend this car to any one!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Hybrid   I bought this car in 2005 its da amzing car .... good look ... progressive car.....u should try it ... class! This car is a great overall mid-size car. If you want a nice looking, good performing, I have one in silver which I got for 18K.Build Quality is awsome .Appearance is beautiful ... leather interior .. Performance is high class low average available wid NOSS ...."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Toyota Corolla S 2007   I bought this car to stem the cost of gas for my truck. 38 MPG on the highway is much better than 18. It only had 11 miles on it when I picked it up. It has incredible handling and it's much easier to park. Roomy interior, great sound system. It's fun to drive...so much so I have gotten a couple speeding tickets since I got it. Has pretty good acceleration for a 4-cylinder. Fairly strong build, of course some of the body is plastic. But got into a fender bender and not even a scratch. Maintenance costs have been very low, just taking care of the usual stuff."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Love My Tinker Toy   Excellent on gas mileage. It may not be a sports car but its a roam around car that is cheap to maintain and great on gas! Its built solid. Only one flaw about it is it sways on the highway when there's alot of wind blowing. Best car I bought yet!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Corolla S   My Corolla S is a pretty awesome car. It's a great family car. It's got plenty of room in the trunk to pack for 2 small children & myself. It's got plenty of room on the inside for the kids not to pick on eachother. It's a pretty fun car to drive even without kids in it. I can remember the first night I had it... I went out, & i was heading home from a friends & got it up to 110mph. so yeah... not bad for a stock corolla. haha"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Crap   Don't even think about this car, underpowered, has the vague steering feeling all toyota's have. Econobox all I can say."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,400 Miles To The Tank!!!   5-Speed Tranny STOCK!
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car   The Corolla is a great car. The S model comes with a nicley tuned suspension, has great gas milage, and a nice looking dash and trim."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Incredible Bang For The Buck !   I am not objective. This is my fourth Toyota in a row ! I am not objective. This is a bargain, cheap, great fuel efficiency, good comfort, best in the world reliability, No toyota has ever let me down."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Smooth Riding,   I love this car. It rides smooth gets great gas mileage. Handles all road types nicely."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Excellent Compact Car.   Good value for the money, even more than that. This car has a quiet ride, clean emission, it has one of the best good power/fuel economy ratios, even with the automatic. The steering maybe a little distant for some people. The controls lack the spicy of the Honda civic and Mazda3. Can be a little bite noisy in the freeway with 70 miles + A little bite pricy over some other compact cars like Ford Focus, Chevy Cobalt and Dodge caliber, that extra will be back to you with free mechanical problems, cheap maintenance and good service."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Reliable To The Core   To call it impressive would be an understatement - even with only 126 horses, this baby makes driving look like a cakewalk!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Excellent!   The acceleration is amazing, is very stable and soft to drive in high speeds"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Perfect Car For Long Commute!   Handling is way better than older Corrolla, but of course it cannot be considered sporty yet. Gas mileage is excellent. On the freeway, I get about 39 miles per gallon. It also provides a lot of head and leg room, although it is not very wide. Very reliable, with nothing much to break or maintain."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Reliable   This baby saves you MPG's
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car, Fuel Efficient, Reliable!!!   Great car, fuel efficient, reliable!!!"
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Attractive Styling, Generous Equipment Levels.   Very nice car to drive, smooth and quiet, I bought this back in Dec '07, very happy with it. Love the convenience of cruise control and steering audio controls and bluetooth hands free phone connection. Plenty of storage space."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Gearbox, Shape And Interior. Definately The Best Corolla Ever Made.   With 6 speed manual and an all new engine with Dual VVTi Technology, with standard ABS, this little beauty lives little that you could want."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Gas Mileage, Great Handling, Very Reliable   Very basic car but it has decent power with DOHC, 4 cylinder, very light weight car, freat gas mileage, and handles perfectly."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Love This Car.   I had a 1999 corolla,until I had an accident in it at 99,000 miles.It never gave me any trouble.This car sits up higher and I think it just handles alot better than my other one."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Handling Car, Plenty Of Room, Great Gas Mileage!   Love the car but hate the fact that water from the roof comes in as soon as I open my door. It also drips on the plastic plate that is inside the door, parallel to the driver and passsenger seat. When it snows, it will be a disaster!!! Also, when my wipers are on the intermittent cycle, the motor clicks each time they come back down toward the dash board."
2007,Toyota ,Corolla,Travel Car   I bought this car as a travel car. I travel to work every fourth day about 120 miles round trip. I talked to people who owned corollas and they said they were pretty reliable cars and last a long time. I currently get about 40 mpg as a combo with mainly hwy and moderate city driving.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great car, not fun to drive."

2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car With Awesome Dependability And Gas Sipping Engine   This car is great in almost every aspect, besides the issues with some places of the car that should be easily looked at (interior fuse box) being in extremely difficult locations. Very tight fit for changing a headlight bulb, license plate light bulb, other small otherwise simple maintenance issues."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Awesome Sport Looking Car That's Reliable, Great Mpg, Great First Car   I need to spice it up. I need to put some sweet rims on it. Possibly a full body kit. Possibly a spoiler wing. Wish it was faster. Can't complain about the gas mileage though. It would be cool to spice the car up, but Asian people have put such a stereotype on tricking out your car, that I'm kind of scared to do it. I feel like I will get a lot of crap from people. But it will look cool. It won't surprise me if people expect me to be an Asian driving the car."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Fun, Reliable And Functional Toyota   I bought the car new in 08 and only had to replace front brakes and one set of tires in the 5+ years I owned. For a small, 4 cylinder car it had plenty of power and had big car comfort in my opinion. I sold it to the sister of my son's girlfriend, so it's kinda still in the family. Corollas are great, reliable little cars!"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Little Car With Plenty Of Power!!   I love this little car, its fast, great gas mileage, and very smooth handeling. It has alot of room also for a little sport/economy car. This is the perfect car for driving around and especially for traveling. Dont let the brand of car fool you, it has some power, it has that get up and go."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Economy Version Of Economy Car   Like; cheap on gas, never broke down once in the 140,000 km we drove it. Faithful vehicle, forgives occasional lapses of care (forgot oil change? no problem). Handles surprisingly well given the rickety feeling and small engine. The small weight of vehicle compensates for the weak engine, and yes, it can accelerate! Hate: the cheaply made interior and manual window handles, and no power locks. We bought it almost new for our teenage daughter, so it was meant to be basic, but we would not do it again. Feels rickety."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Excellent Performances   cost of maintenace is so affordable and has a very fashionable interior. fun to drive. very good building quality that makes it last at services. travel very far with economical fuelling. has a very low ability to carry cargo. i love this car.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Excellent!   I like the ability to go anywhere for very little money in gas or maintainance bills. Cost to own is very low, especially for how comfortable and quiet this car is. The car is legendary Toyota quality and backs it up every day!"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Value For Money, Efficient, Fun To Drive, But Not Really Sporty.   Performance - Above average, not exactly meant for spirited driving though. Build Quality - Poor material quality, average workmanship. Appearance - Looks good overall but slightly dated, detailing better is better on the latest model. Cost Of Ownership - Good gas mileage, cheap to maintain. Fun Factor - This car isn't meant for outright performance driving, but its quite a good drive."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Very Good Choice New   Any Corolla is as common as stars in the sky but they certainly provide good service for the price. excellent fuel economy, reasonable cost of ownership. More conservative than Honda but that makes finding used safer - less sporty = less abuse."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"High Quality Reachable Price   Performance is quite good for 1600cc though I wish it had manuel transmission. It has no problems at all and has a low maintenance fee. In my opinion apperance of the car is really good for a sedan. It is suitable for a family or a company car. Since it works with oil it consumes alot of it. 8litres/100kilometers what I have measured with 75km city driving and 25 highway driving. I love driving it, comfortable for long drives"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Great Car   great car its great on gas it has plenty of room inside for passengers and for the driver. very smooth at any speed. it can move quick but not much on power. it is very a all around good car for short to medium distance.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Good For Old People   it has good braking. it has seven airbags i like that it is red. it also has good fuel consumption but it is a slow car and has bad acceleration. its too big for such a small engine making it sluggish
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Nice Handleing!   Nice steering (Handleing) Smooth ride even on reg. ground Plenty of room, Trunk? eh I didn't look! Other wise I just moved it place to place to get it out of the way. I like it because its an easy smooth car."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"This Is A Great Car   I think this is the best car I have ever owned. the quality is great it only has 125 horsepower so its not fast, but it looks good I get 35 mpg in it . I wouldn't say its the most fun to drive but its comfortable"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Average Performance Having All The Specifications For Families!!!   average performance but still is good from most cars in its league,braking is little rigid,having 1.8l engine acceleration is good.interior and exterior is nice sleek and handy havig more compartments for family gadgets and exterior is balanced and eye catching...overall this car is built for people who travels long with families and friends!!!"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,In My View   Performance- mediocre doesn't likes to be thrashed Build Quality - Little clumsy /rattles otherwise looks strong Appearance- Interior is good Exterior can't say Cost of Ownership- Reasonable till now changed brake pads didn't cost much. Fun Factor- NONE its not fun to drive
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Needed A Reliable Vehicle For Working At Multiple Sites - Does A Great Job.   Manual everything. Mileage great and maintenance costs low. Clean look - certainly not fancy. Not a fast car by any means, but with standard you can accelerate as quickly as necessary in traffic. Controls are positive and not crazy - making it fun to drive."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Gud   w3ll itx a nice car wid sum gud fearture .itx a family car wid gud milage. i jst use it fr going to work ....n doing sum house work .ita a fun car to drive. it has gt a great body :P n dat it ....bla bla
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Rola (tofa7a)   Performance: pretty decent acceleration, braking and handling. Your typical Japanese sedan Build Quality: fragile as paper, don't hit anything!! Appearance: Good looking Cost of ownership: Very economic and easy to maintain Fun Factor: Its tiptronic, and the automatic overdrive can be annoying"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"It Works For Now   it is a good car for driving around the city, and on trips. Great Gas mileage. It is a bit expensive thought. It would be better if it were a Manual, instead of a Atomatic. That part is a real bummer."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Long Term Cheap Mobility....go For This One   Great Car at its price. excellent engine, highly reliable, comfy for 4, looks ok, good resale value, don't expect much, just suffice your basic transportation needs... but pick up sucks...engine is noisy...road noise is terrible...bit unsteady at high speeds..."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Cheap And Quiet.   performance isn't terrible seeing it's a complete nerd mobile. I have the 5 speed manual so it's a bit more fun to drive. It weighs 2600 pounds so it's light as a feather and fun to whip around turns. Build quality, well not bad. the AC broke already but it was covered under warranty. It's bland looking. There's a million of these on the road. It's cheap to run, cheap to maintain. 36mpg average. Fun factor...Eh, it's not meant to be fun to drive it's meant to be economical and it does that really well."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,".   I like the interior gauges, and the quality of toyota parts, and the performance is alright, you get what you pay for. the cost of ownership is not much to maintain. no, the car is not fun to drive at all."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"The Toyota Corolla Not All Its Cracked Up To Be   Performance-acceleration (really jumpy, not good for stop and go traffic, uses a lot of gas to accelerate) braking (seems fine but also brand new so brakes are brand new) handling (okay but I owned a german car before so handling doesn't even compare) Build Quality-repairs (none just brought it in for the check up) squeaks/rattles (none that I notice) Appearance-interior (sleek but also kind of pointy and straight edges, seats are not that comfy and have limited mobility, back seats are squished, and air doesn't go to the back very well) exterior (My is the aqua green color I love the color choices and its a cute little car compared to the Honda civic counterpart) Cost Ownership (good gas mileage and maintenance you just have to bring it to the toyota dealership)"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,My Car: The '08 Toyota Corolla   very quiet. smooth handling / cornering. reliable and predictible. spacious. good visability. basic easy to use / view interior / dash controls. good gas mileage. takes almost everything you throw at it. more family oriented as opposed to sports car but definately decent.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Excellent   Gets me from A to B. Quality is very good and fairly well priced. Overall fairly inexpensive to maintain and repair and parts are decently priced. Car is fun to drive other than its not a V12 sportscar. Excellent vehicle to travel in.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla 2008   Performance - small engines, everything's good Build Quality - excellent Appearance - front - excellent, back - mediocre Cost of ownership - especially great Fun factor - It's more for relaxed driving than fast&furious but anyway you can drive it on daily basis without any difficulty.."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Disappointing   The first thing I noticed was how little you get for your money when you buy a Corolla. On the test drive, the car was very noisy especially on the highway and the steering/handling was terrible. It's very unstable and in my opinion its unsafe. In addition to that the engine rattled somewhat like a diesel."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Nice Car   I love my car, great on gas! Maintenance is very low. Performance is pretty good. This car is really fun to drive. Very quiet ride, love the styling. Very sporty, love the 6 disk changer, stereo system is pretty good. High resale value is great to. I would recommend it to anyone!"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Toyota Corolla   Very good made car.Good engine and gear box works like orhiestra. Acceleration is good (less than 10 sec to 100km/h) Brakes are good and road of brake is short. Materials inside are good quality what makes car silence inside and good car audio system. I admire to drive this car.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"An Above Average Corolla   The Toyota Corolla is normally billed as the most boring car you could buy. In some ways that is true, its never been an outstanding car and whatever it does well will be defeated next year since it only does well in categories like fuel economy, reliability, etc. Now this version of the Corolla, the 2003-2008 version, has been largely ignored by most auto enthusiasts. I don't feel that this particular car is deserving of the most boring title, I believe that's better suited to the Corolla that replaced this one. To drive, this Corolla made do with only 128 hp so it wasn't exactly that fast. Handling...it wasn't too good since the Corolla had quite a lot of body roll due to its soft suspension. However this Corolla does have proper steering feel something Toyota has not done well with lately especially with the new one. There are moments where you could have some mild fun, although the XRS is the one to get if this is your thing. The interior in this car is nicely coloured and styled modestly. The plastics on this car range from quite cheap to decent, I don't think they're as bad as certain cars. Although the lack of much metal is one thing this Corolla doesn't address. Build quality from Cambridge Ontario has been very good. Despite seeing several trashed Corollas with 60,000 kms, none have fallen apart or lost any pieces. I actually consider this car a better car than the one that replaces it. Its a shame this version has to live with the most boring exterior designs in the auto industry."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Nice   Very Good Performance except the handling factor Moderate acceleration Ratio Good Build Quality I Faced a problem with the Braking System but now its OK Nice Appearance Exterior & Interior Cost of Ownership is little expensive Having Fun While Driving 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Awesome Ride   This car saves you $$$ on gas. I am a student and I drive a lot and this car is perfect. Performance wise this car is moderate not really a speed machine and not really school bus slow. The car looks great and feels great. If you buys this car from the dealer buy it with the sunroof worth the extra money.
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Fuel Economy   I love this car!! I even got 45 miles to the gallon once. The color is great and the wood grain is soothing. I've taken it camping, and even I can carry all I need."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Toyota Corolla   That it is very powerfull with the new 1600 C.C. motor with 142 H.P. but i dislike the shift transmition because the gear box is only five speed which is not compatible with the motor power, so the gear box need to be six speed."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good City Commuter, Not Very Sporty   After having driven the Corolla all the way to the north coast about 250 KM from my place, I can say it's good enough, not my cup of tea though; VERY good city cruiser, especially in our lovely Egyptian roads, if you're looking for more comfort its a good choice. If you're sports cars oriented (like me :D) you wont be able to live with it for long, you'd better look somewhere else."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good On Gas   good on gas, but alot of rattlings and its CHEAP made....reliable..."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"2008 Toyota Corolla S   IT's an ok car, reliable, but im paying too much for it. The rear window seal is coming out already which is weird, tiniting it made a huge difference but has nothing to do with the seal problem."
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,Awesome!!   It takes my car a little while to speed up but when it gets going it's going and the gas mileage is 39-43 miles to the gallon
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Looking Sedan Would Rate This Car A 9 Out Of 10   The 2008 Toyota Corolla S is a very nice looking car it drives really good and accelerates well and the engine noise is okay and it's really quiet inside the car while it's idling, gets pretty noisy when accelerating on the highway and when it going at high speeds (50+mph) the only thing that bothers me is the noise it makes inside the cabin when driving on bumpy roads (maybe it's because the S model's interior is made with plastic and that's why it's so bad. my friend's '03 LE does not make any noises)"
2008,Toyota ,Corolla,A Very Good Car   South African Corolla 1.6 (91kW) Advanced specification in Ice Blue. Car is only 2 months old. Nothing at all gone wrong so far. And nothing ever did in 3 years. Now sold in favour of a 2011 Corolla 2.0 Sprinter
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Good car but needed more room.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,a solid nice car with good gas mileage and reliability
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"""Fold down armrests"""
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"""Back seat folds down."""
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"""it feels a little heavier"""
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"""the good buying price and the superior gas mileage"""
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Loved It.   I loved everything it had to offer, it was nifty, fuel economical. Very reliable; Toyota sure knows how to make 'em! Parts were never SO expensive. over all I LOVED it and would buy one again, same year and everything."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Blackie   2/4/14 I just got it today, drove home 20 mile. Great, smooth ride...radio was loud. Pick-up to get on freeway and accelerate was good. Seat was comfortable. I like blinker turn signal knob. Will see how it does in traffic tomorrow."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car, Great Low Price   this is the best car in my opinion for under or close to 10 grand, seats 5 comfortably gets a consistent 30mpg+ and costs very little to own. reliability is off the charts and its very easy to resell. excellent buy"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla   Its a great car,, looks nice, moves smooth , cost so little to maintain. easy to handle and not complicated like the other new cars Fuel Economy. you can drive from Jax to Miami for 30$. Have a great A/C system."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Love It, Fun To Drive   Traded my 2005 Mustang and got the top of the line 2009 Corolla XRS , Silver, w/59K miles, used. This car is great , fun to drive and saves me gas not like my mustang. Yeah miss my mustang but decided to get something to save gas and will have a great trade in value should I decide to let it go in 3 or 4 years...maybe :) So far, no problems whatsoever."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Fun To Drive And Attractive Design/color.   It's a lot more fun to drive than our SUV and averages approximately 29 MPG currently. We're taking it on a freeway road-trip soon so hopefully that average will go up significantly. With gas prices over $4/gallon right now that is very helpful.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great Car   I like this car a lot and would not get rid of it accept there is not enough interior room for a rear facing car seat behind the front seats, The person in front of the carseat only has 8 to 12 inches of knee space"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Its A Great Car To Drive   Well I like the fact that it has the camry's 2.4L engine and it gives great gas mileage. I just didnt like the fact that Toyota could have done more to make it a much better car to have fun with!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,I Love It   Excellent car. Easy to drive and handle on the road. Very cheap to maintain. Reliable and can be trusted when it comes to safety majors. A smaller version of the Camry. But not much difference in price. I will not hesitate recommending this car for family use.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Like It   Cargo Capacity is too small. Performance on the high way is much better than expected. The maintenance and parts are very cheap. I just replaced, the from tires, front breaks + completed detailing for less than $ 300. The air condition is excellent ( very cold). My wife loves it as it is easy to handle and control on the road."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Awesome!!!!!!!   This is a really great car, never been in an accident. Drives smoothly, very clean and spacious on the inside. Power everything. It is awesome on gas. It was not over used as travelling to and from work was its main purpose. The car was really taken care of and driven with much care."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"It's A Way To Have Fun To Work.   This a great car for going to work at distant places like say, middle of Massachusetts to Boston. It would only take a little less then a quarter of a take of gas! The acceleration is ok for a car, not really the greatest, however the brakes never fail. This car stops on a dime."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Will Definately Drive Another Toyota In My Driving Life.   Great little economical vehicle. I traded in my Tundra, which I loved, to save on gas. It's gotten me around town in sporty style especially after I added the leather. Have never had a mechanical issue. Actually fun to drive around and I laugh at all the gas guzzlers as I cruise past the gas stations."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Do Not Pass This One Up!   Runs great and never been in an accident. GREAT GAS MILEAGE' Fun to drive and handles like a dream. Never had a problem with this car. The Toyota Corolla is the best selling car in the world. Once you pass up the gas station and don't need gas you will have a big smile on your face! Priced to MOVE FAST!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Good Buy   Great on gas. Has a very quite cabin. Appropriately priced. The brakes are not the best in the world. Needs more horsepower. The sports trim is the only one with more than 1.8L engine but it costs more than entry level Camry.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"The Monster   perfomance is good but the acceleration is not enough build quality is good its looks good ""thats what i like the most"" the one and only fault is the petrol consumption but after all its a fun car to drive"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Knight Rider   New Corrolla 2009 xli its 1300cc Vvti engine its performance is excellent, In few seconds it reaches on 100. The main quality of this car is its apperance. it has excellent exterior style its front lights are eagle style and it also contain good interior,it is a comfortable car aslo. Its is best for family car and it can used for sports also. It just not need repairing for long time.Its handling is best and its brakes are also good it does not contain any fault in handling in fast speed or in braking and in toyta corrolla Gli it contain ABS brakes system. The main difference B/w Xli and Gli is ABS brakes system."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Your S Is Not The Same Car   It's a good looking car, I get compliments almost every day. Not bad on gas either. I get about 24 mpg the way i drive. Could get better mileage tho. It is pretty quick and fun to drive. Has the same engine as the scion tc and 4 cylinder model toyota camry. more horsepower than the base mitsubishi lancer and honda civic. wish more perfomance parts were available but its still a fun car."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Love It.   i like the gas mileage abot my corolla.. its the perfect size for someone my age. it rides really good. i dont have power seats so its hard to get my seat in the perfect spot after someone ajusts it!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Do Not Want!   performance-none slow, drum brakes, handles like a big ol' pretzel. build quality- as you know its had about 5 recalls, the windshield washer nozzles dont stop spraying, the power steering sucks and for sum reason it has a canister oil filter. appearance- it looks like smurfette had a few too many big macs. cost- 33mpg and dropping, oil filter is expensive due to it being a rarer type. fun factor- negative 7"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Wouldn't Trade This Car For Any Other. :)   This car actually gets up & goes. :) So far, 3 recalls, but is an excellent car. I love the sport interior. :) Gets 31.2 mpg average. I have a great time driving this car & taking on long trips. I highly recommend Toyota."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"This Car Is Just For Looks/getting From Point A Through Point B   Engine- Dohc 2.4l vvt-i Performance- (0-60) 7.8 seconds. Handling- Handling is decent the electronic pwr steering feels fake. Build Quality- There was a recall for the accelerator. Apperance- Quite nice body shape; Interior is a new fresh look, but theres a lot of cheapy plastic on the doors and dash. Gas Mileage- Average is 25mpg."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,I Still Like It   everything is good. steering is too sweet. i just dont like the power. its not good enough for the weight of this car. and the visibility is not good. i cant seem to know where my car is going. bumbers are too big.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Overall Its A Car For The Average Person   The thing I dislike the most about my car is the fact that it does not look as sporty as I would like it to be. Not as quick as my previous cars. Although I do like the gas mileage.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,It Has Power   performance excellant no repairs (so far) fast engine 2.4 L 8.1 / 100 L turns on a dime drives like a baby smooth interior metalic silver vtt kicks in at 3000 nice electric windows sound system good could do about 13-15 seconds on a quarter mile
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Top In Its Group   Performance not bad could use a bit more power but not going to complain about the gas millage. Breaking is alright. appearance exterior is best in class interior not bad. its the dependibility that makes me love this car nothing no rattles or squeecks and a blast to drive i never want to get out of it. toyota #1 in my book
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Awesomeness   This car is perfect for me. Good gas mileage. Just the right size. Toyota is very dependable and the service is excellent. Not that we expect you to die in one, but god forbid if you do, there is a shrine built for you."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Corolla, I Love It!!   It's a bit of a rare find from what I've been told, it's a 5 speed! One minor recall that took a whamping 30 minutes to perform. Love the looks of the car, very sleek/stylish! MPG's are awsome: 24-32 in city (depending on what gear I choose)/ 34-40 on hwy. Over all a very fun car, couldn't ask for a better or more fun ""family"" car."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"This Car Has The Best Handling And Acceleration Sytem!   Its a speedy car with royalty! Its comfortable to drive and it has excellent Braking, Acceleration and a handling System! Its interior system gives a royal comforting look and its exterior Styling challenger Honda City, Civic and Liana, and several other cars. This car is handy in drifting, speed racing and stunts.its Audio System supports usb cable connected to a compatible device. It has a huge carriage facility.Its AC and heater both are well and nice! GLI"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Very Pleased   Great performance, some of the gauges, etc. are in weird places. So I can't say the ease of operating inside features are easy. Have to put new brake pads on only one month after purchase. This concerns me. Classic body style comparable to the upper Classis, the Camry"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Braking   Poor performance, Poor Braking, feel bad with handling, too much cheap plastic for interior trim, good consumption, silver color very nice, build quality not so bad can except able, easy to under steer, always squeaks when driving on non smooth surface"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Toyota Corolla   Performance - it runs like a 6cyl i love it Build Quality - its built well i guess. except the air duct under the passengerside dashboard keeps falling out-_- Appearance - i love it. its metallic blue the interior is black and tan with blue and silver accents, i know that sounds weird but its just cuz im bad at discribing Cost of Ownership - its like $20 a week for gas Fun Factor - its actually really fun to drive, and half the time your going a lot faster then you realize=)"

2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Its Awesome Nothing To Worry Abt While Buying It   this car is awesome i like everything it had. Specially its exterior is mind blowing. good mileage and specially the sound system is perfect. i only dislike its silver door panel which colour had faded as it was of bad quality used by toyota rest of it ROCKS!!!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Value For Money   performance is good acceleration is excellent braking and handling too, build quality is good never require any thing but normal service is enough, Appearance is good looks like younger sister of Camary. Gas mileage is good comparing to other cars in this segment but fast moving spare pearts are expensive like side mirrors. i like to drive this car"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Best Car   Relating to Pakistani cars its 2009 performance is very good its evry thing its brakes ,engine ,its body etc. The build quality is very good not so hard and not so much week .Its appearance is very stylish and comfortable."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,My Corolla S   love my new car should have sacraficed the gas and gotten the XRS 2.4 L but still love my S 1.8 L would have gotten a little more pick up to the acceleration. For my S i get 27/35 . Love this car!!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"It Is Good And Reliable   performance---mdiocre at speed in its class. braking is reliable enough, hadling is perfect build quality is good, appearence is awesome, best in its class, gas mileage is very nice, fun factor is alright, hadling at high speed is awesome"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Gud To Explore   Its a nice ride, with immense power, good for handling and the best Mid-range Sedan in this category which is affordable. It can be made more stylish by addin outer accessories and also on performance packs too !! Hell a smooth ride !!"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Toyota Corolla 2009   Accelerates good especially after 100 km/h, top speed is over 190 km/h, brakes are way better than previous Corolla and handles great. Didn't need much repairs till now except that i had to install a new wheel bearing, don't know why and just change air filter every month, going to install intake this week. Fuel consumption is very less. Exterior is very nice, especially the LED rear lights and the Black Side View Mirror with Indicator. Interior looks a little cheap because of plasticky material but very comfortable and easy. The car is really nice and comfortable to drive, i use it for extreme driving and had no problems till now, except that the original 'Euro Star' tires had a very bad grip."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great First Car And Etc.   acceleration could be better with a much bigger engine, but then the mpg would obviously get worse, the brakes are amazing, handles very well, no squeaks/rattles, looks amazing and sporty, low maintenance cost, and its just really fun to drive"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,It's Just A Car   It's just a car. I lease it. It's maybe a little too American feeling for my tastes. It is comfortable and does all the car stuff I ask it to do. I have a Kawasaki Ninja ZX6R for when I want to go faster.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Cheap To Run, Lots Of Room...great Car   Solid as a rock - no problems at all in almost a year, not bad looking for a four-door family car, lots of room for stuff and legs, cheap to run, comfy, not the most exciting to drive but great family vehicle."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Bad Shifter For Automatic   The first thing I noticed about this car I really dislike, is the gear shift. Between Drive and 3rd you are a simple bump away, it does not lock into Drive. So if you have a large passanger or a child they could easily down shift you at the wrong time. Other than that in the first 24 hours I am very happy with the purchase."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"My New Car   I love this car. It is the greatest. It rides real smooth and is very quiet. But anything more than my 1999 Corolla is a BIG improvement. It is definitely bigger than the 99 Corolla I had all these years. The CD player is great, and it is just really roomy. What don't I like - CAR PAYMENT. But this is my new baby for the next like FOREVER. Ya know?"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"The Car Is Good For Starting Drivers Who Are Seeking A New Car.   Performance: Acceleration is slightly underpowered. Braking takes a while and the pads seem to wear rather fast (stock brakes). The power steering makes this car handle like a luxury car but with some sporty feel. Build Quality: So far, since January 09 to present(May 09) there has been no repairs needed. It seems to be a sturdy one inside and out. Appearance: The front exterior looks amazing from an angled view at night, but the back seems to be slightly plain, with the help of the spoiler (Sports Package). The interior has much better design and quality and has much more space for its passengers. It keeps its sporty appearance from the outside in. Overall appearance is great. I love it very much. Cost of Ownership: For a car with a rated 27/35 mpg, the actual mileage in a city(where I live) seems to average 25-28mpg depending on driving style. The maintenance cost has yet to be determined since I've only gotten one oil change/tire rotation. Fun Factor: For the power, not so much fun since it's an eco car to save gas costs. If on the little extreme side, it would be quite fun, that is if you can handle the front wheel drive."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Sterring Is Not Driving Straight   My steering is not naturally drive forward but tries to steer right or left! It's as if I was a young kid with my mike handle bars turned around and it trying to turn the 180 degrees. It will not track straight. I love the MPG but I know a few others that have the same silly problem that may be dangerous if you just take you eye off the road for just a second.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Great Mpg - Dangerous Power Steering   Steering Control system - I can't keep the car in my lane at Hwy speeds. Toyota checked my car and they find nothing wrong. I am worried I will have a crash but they say the feedback issue is normal for the Corolla 2009.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,My Amazing Sport Car   I love the style of my car. I park far away from other cars so im sure that i wont get any dents. I had my car for 5 months now and i still cant help looking at it. I love the inside of my car as well as the out. The black and blue interior is amazing. The only thing the sport needs is a moon/sun ruff. That always makes any car look much better. I only wish it had more horse power and that the shell of the car was made stronger. My back bumper is so weak. I hardly backed into a car and my car was the only one messed up. But i Still Love My Car!!!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla   The soft music of a powerful engine combined with the stability makes you feel unity with its metal, simply I wanna drive it forever.... simple but i like it and if you drive it fast you will see but not very fast lol"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla 09   good performance... i like the blue color... looks great wiyh tinted windows... godd stereo and speakers, at least average... aux plug... great ac and heater... a good value for your money... its stick shift and i love driving it!!! very fuel efficient.. good features (outside temp, tire pressure, mpg at current speed)..."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"2009 Toyota Corolla S   The '09 has better safety features then the '07, 6 air bags in front and rear. Anti lock breaks (all of the new corollas now require to have the anti lock breaks). Steering is nice and smooth. This car has more room then the '07 and is better in the comfort area. The build of this car is almost like the build of a Toyota Camery. I love how this car no longer has an antenna sticking up and how the mirrors fold in. I love how the seats have a unique sport fabric. These seats look so easy to clean up if you or your children were to make a mess. But what I really love about this car is that not only does it have that sporty look to it, but it is great on gas mileage and that is always a plus. Toyota cars have always been great and I would continally buy from the Toyota company."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,2009 Toyota Corolla   Cost of ownership is excellent because it is very frugal with fuel. Toyota build quality is second to none. I live 8 hours from the nearest dealer and I am so sure that I will not have trouble that this fact is not a problem. The styling is rather coservative. the performance is not spectacular but is definitely sufficient. I would prefer a standard shift for the fun factor but my wife's arthritis prevents me from indulging this preference.
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"A Car For The Accountants, Not For The Driving Enthusiast   The new 2009 Corolla is a car I just can't like. It to me is a symbol of all the things that are wrong with Toyota now. I gave it an average style rating because truthfully its just a downgraded Camry so its not pretty nor ugly, pretty boring actually. So why is the rating so low, is it the reliability? No since none of these have given me a problem. Fuel economy? Definitely not, its actually very good. Quality? Not exactly since the build quality on the cars at least coming from Cambridge is excellent. I must say though the quality of the plastics in this car are quite cheap, scratch easily and feel cheap despite being coloured nicely. Its actually how the car drives which really turned me off. The power on this car...slightly better than the 2003-2008 version but not noticeable. The handling...same problem as last time not too good and still has a lot of body roll. The worst thing from this car is...the electronic power steering. The system put into this 2009 Corolla is so overboosted, there is no feel to it. You cannot sense whether your going straight or drifting off into another lane. Buicks normally have this problem but even they have not designed a steering system so lifeless. This is definitely not a drivers car, it will never be fun. The problems from the last car still occur, only this time the car is far more boring to drive. This might be a great car for people who only think dollars when it comes to cars but I suggest a Yaris if your stick with Toyota. I love driving...but if all cars drove like this...I'd find my commutes the least fun part of my day instead of being the most fun."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Not Bad   The car is almost has high as a SUV, acceleration is pretty good for a Toyota, but the CD sometimes does not play some Discs, or the Discs get Jammed in the player,I do wish this problem can be taken care of. Apart from that it is a lovely car."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"My Boy Toy!!!   I am in love with my new Toyota!! I actually label it as my new boyfriend. He rides really smooth, efficient, and fast. He is a little pricy, but what guy isn't? I love the feel when i can ride him around town and know that he's mine for at least the next 5 years... Haha!!!"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Yay   I love it it looks like i customized it myself but i didnt plus its got a sporty look that i like with all the safety features of a family car! its a quick little car too with a sweet system i reccommend!
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,Toyota Corolla 2009 Is A Pretty Good Car I Believe   i have no complains honestly...but just that it accelerates to quick even when your not even pushing the pedal down very much. Theres really nothing bad or wrong with it other than that.

2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"I Love This Car.   Coming from a SUV to a car, was a big change, but I love the corolla, it runs great, and is just an overall amazing car. Could use a little more power though."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Great!...for A 4 Door.   Extremely responsive, great gas mileage, averaging about 30.5 to 33 MPG. Not bad interior. No need to replace the seats, already pretty sporty. Sound system is okay, needed to get the JBL package, but not availabe on the S, you have to get the XLE. A bit on the heavy side, but the 1.8L actually moves it pretty good."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Very Nice   working late at my dealership, I managed to grab the first 09 corolla to roll off the truck. At first glance I thought it was a shortened version of the camry with it's new stubed nose, but after driving it I was very happy with the results that the new corolla engine produced which is the new 2ZR 1.8. Although I will always miss the 2ZZ with the 6 speed"
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Good Value And Fun   My wife rented one of these on vacation. She came back talking about how fun and easy it was to drive and park and she drove it 3 days on a half tank of gas. So I got her one, but on longer trips her arthritis bothered her a lot, so I got her a Camry with a plush power seat. So we are selling it, but it's a nice car."
2009,Toyota ,Corolla,"Corolla 09 View   nice braking.steering regular.suspension good. Build Quality - yes,,u know toyotass! Appearance - front bumper,grill,interior.don""t like the rear bumper.

2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Love This Car   What is there to not like about this car excellent gas mileage, nice power easy to handle. Interior is very comfortable leather power seats, power windows, power locks, roomy, nice radio just a very enjoyable car. I would highly recommend this car."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Family Sedan   The 2007 Toyota Camry has decent body style, better than prior years. It drives nicely and I have never had any major repair or maintenance issues. It has been a solid, reliable, low maintenance, efficient car for me for over 7 years, and will likely run for 7 more. It's not the most exciting car in the world to drive but it gets you from A to B without fail."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Family Car, Reliable, Popular   toyota is pretty good in taking care of the customers. the 2007 Camry has seen 3 recalls all repaired/to be repaired by dealer at no charge. 1. gas pedal 2. sun Visor 3. entire dashboard cover The camry 2007 version is the best looking camry. like it very much. the car is reliable, smooth."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Excellent , Reliable And Comfortable   Excellent handling and power. I haven't really faced any issues with the car so far. Very comfortable ride both for driver and passenger. Not great for city driving. If you end up taking internal routes for commuting, this engine will DRINK fuel"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Poor Design. Toyota Tried To Defy The Laws Of Physics With This Big 4 Cylinder Car   Simply not a high quality car, especially in the context of my 2 previous Toyotas. A multitude of minor and major problems from plastic parts falling off, to soft paint that can be indented with a thumbnail to a wheel column shimmy this car has simply been a problem from day one. Throw in the terrible acceleration and I am looking at a Subaru now. Had been intending to drive this car for 200K miles."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Best Car I've Ever Owned   I would highly recommend this car, but hope Toyota boosts mileage in next model release. Sound system is excellent, JBL speakers are powerful, dynamic. Only features this model year is missing would be side view mirror turn indicators and blind spot warnings."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Great Car For Normal Familly Use   i like this car it runs really great and the room is great for family and long driving it is very comfortable and when you go on trips you are really very safe and at ease because this car will give you the feeling that you can handle anything that arises on the road i highly reccommend this car for family use and driving efficience.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Gret Car For The Mainstream Commuting Public   The Camry was the hand me down from my wife as she drives the GMC Acadia. I traded my 2002 GMC Sierra Denali pickup with Quadrasteer for the Acadia. I have increased my gas mileage my 75 percent, my gas bill has fallen 50 percent and I can comfortably transport all three grandchildren in comfort."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Ideal For A Family Car Without Giving Up Performance And Luxury.  
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Ideal For A Family Car Without Giving Up Performance And Luxury.   When this car first came out I immediately loved it, thought it was sexy even (and its a 4 door-wow). I hand picked this specific car and have been very pleased with it. When I go to pass, I walk right past the other guy, very responsive for a V6. I have the JBL premium sound system and for a stock system, it sounds great. I am short (5' 2"") and the power drivers seat adjusts perfectly, this is not easy to find in most cars. It also accommodates taller drivers nicely."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Very Good Impression.   When I was car shopping I didn't really look at any Toyota's cause I was kind of scared with all the recalls they've had lately. After looking for a few weeks, I finally broke down & took one for a test drive & absolutely feel in love with it. I have had my car for about a month now & am loving it!!! Nice smooth comfortable ride, I get about 30mpg which I'm very happy with."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Car For The Type (family) And Price   It's a family car that has great look style and average performance, with the 3.5l v6 engine. To make it a little more interesting, I Installed 4 new KYB struts and HID all out (4300k bumper, 8000k low beam, and 5000k high beam). I also swapped out the steel rims and installed 4 new 18"" TSW rims wrapped in low profile performance tires."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Great Car   this car gives a lot for the price i paid. These cars run almost forever if they are maintained properly. they also look great and are suitable for all types of people. I would recommend this car for all people
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"My First Toyota Camry And Will Buy Another   Excellent Mileage per tank, I average anywhere between 31-37 depending on weather. I really enjoy the comfortable ride, bluetooth phone, and the JBL sound system included by Toyota. The water pump was leaking but was covered under warranty at 40,000 miles by Toyota. (Technician noticed it and replaced it)"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Camry Se   I drove this car for 5 years and put 55,000 miles on it. I liked the size and it was relatively fun to drive for not being a sports car. Never had a problem mechanically and would buy another. Probably a hybrid Camry if I was to go with a larger sedan."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Very Dependable And Econmical.   Comfortable, quiet and a pleasure to drive. We liked it so much we bought another. They want to write more words but in my book less is more. But here are the unnecessary last twelve words that the webmaster wanted."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Not Fun To Drive. It Is A Family Sedan After All.   Performance - acceleration, braking, handling :very nice with strong yet quiet engine. Build Quality - has it needed repairs? squeaks/rattles: above average. Better than most of the car in the segment. However, there are some noticeable squeaks and rattles from plastic parts. Also the fit and finish is about average, and use of cheap plastic materials throughout interior. Compare to Honda Accord, Toyota Camry has poor interior quality and luxuriousness. Appearance - both interior and exterior styling: Class leading appearance especially SE model. XLE is also nice and updated feel. Cost of Ownership - gas mileage, maintenance: V6 model has good fuel economy ratings compare to other V6s, but because of high gas price, it is quite costly to fill the tank. Maintenance cost is relatively low thanks to longevity of every parts and systems. Also, it has above average rating of resale value. Fun Factor - is this car fun to drive?: Not sporty fun, but the handling is predictable, smooth and comfortable to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Vehicle For The $   This is an all around great vehicle. I think it is one of the best sedans on the market however, I am a big Toyota fan. Very reliable, great on gas, stylish and I always feel SAFE in this vehicle."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Nice Car   i bought it pre-owned so i'm not quite sure the performance of my unit is indicative of this car's true capapbility. i find the acceleration to be a bit dodgy. it takes a full second or two for the engine to respond in a sudden acceleration scenario
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"This Toyota Shows They Are Not The Quality Like The Toyota Pasts, Stay Away From It.  "
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"This Toyota Shows They Are Not The Quality Like The Toyota Pasts, Stay Away From It.   I bought a lot cars, almost 5-6 a year for tax deductions (then) and enjoy the free use of it from Toyota to MErcedes'. (I used to work, welded mercedes' in the Mercedes factory in Suttgart Germany as a student). I had toyotas since 1970 models, since i got out from the US MArines. So far I have 2 toyotas which is the hallmark of the toyota fake quality image. One is a starlet which almost killed my wife, and the latest one is the camry, this Camry litterally fell apart in front of my eyes. Look at the rear speaker grill, started to crack, i touched it softly and it crumples to little plastic crystal onto the speaker's belly button, horrifying. The steering column wiggle click clak when i made a turn and dealer could not fix it, the wiper blades self destruct after a year and th battery dropped dead one morning. In my 40 years of car buying and some 30 toyotas i bought, the new toyotas is just selling a name , not quality, I bought a Prius , new for $25.000 and took it to the dealer for a trade in 1 year later and they would give me $16000 (10 miles on it), just to show you that the toyota dealers themselves do not have confidence in their cars and trucks. How could the toyota truck stay so expensive??? NOt for demand, but because they make less and sell a lot fewer than they used to , not because it is in demand. If you want a good new car look at the VW PAssat (only) or Hyundai SOnata, the Nissan and toyota pickups are overpriced, and HYunday is dumb enough not make a truck for America, that how toyota got rich in the first place."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Sleek And Economic   When I arrived at the dealership to purchase this car, I automatically loved the clean sleek look of this Black Camry. The only reason it is being sold is because I am now in need of a 4WD car. It is a very comfortable and spacious sedan. I feel very safe and in control when I am driving this car. There has never been any mechanical issues with it making it a very reliable car. The low cost of gas and upkeep is also a huge plus."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Really Good Hybrid   It is just what you expect from Toyota. Very reliable but not exciting.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Car To Have For Driving In The City   i bought it for a good price & because it's white! :) i was dreaming of a white car to have for a long time... :) it's looking nice, prestigeus, and comfortible. but it's sound isolation & interior quality is leaving me to wish more from it..."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Pure Pleasure.   This car is very dependable, is well taken care of and will run well for years to come I am sure. Picures to be put on line soon. Leather seats are soft and smooth and wonderful to slide onto. The seats are electically adjustable and will put you right where you need to be for height and distance from the steering wheel. Smoothness of driving makes this car a pleasure to be in. There has never been a problem with braking or accelertion. It has always been maintained according to the mfr guidelines. This car is worth every penney that is will be bought for."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Low Maintenance, Fun To Drive Car That Keeps Money In Your Pocket   Low maintenance car..Brakes changed at 120K miles. Gas, Tires and oil only needed. 07 has Timing chain so no expensive belt to replace.Toyota quality is everything they say. have had no issues with this car. I have around 45k per year"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Well It Could Be Worse   Its cool, its not a Ford though;-) The Ford Fusion Hybrid has the same technology however the Fusion squeeks out another 200 miles on the tank. Most mine is getting is 500 miles on 1 tank. The Fusion can get 700 miles on tank. (pending how you drive) The bluetooth with phone is horrible, nothing like the SYNC with Ford.. Sync will do a wide range of commands and very easy to use. This style is just not the level of simplistic and fun!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"The Camry Is #1 For A Reason.   Love this car thus far. Comfortable, smooth ride, great gas milage and its got Toyota's legendary build quality. Its only got a 4-cylinder engine, but its still got plenty of power. It might not roast the tires or win many drag races, but its got plenty of power to keep up with traffic. I can see why this is the best selling car in America."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Very Good One   it was one of the most convenient vehicles, and till the time i sold it out i didn't fave any major failurs with it. very popular and easy to sell with a good market value. i love the shape too"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Sedan To Own !   2nd car previously owned a Honda Civic , done 60,000km on this car . Good acceleration but still not good enough for a 2.4L , should be around 9 second for 0-60 . Brake is amazing , did a few emergency brake , avoided an accident a few weeks ago . Handling is not good , it's disappointing ! The body roll is savage , how can a big sedan have so much body roll when cornering , rear passenger can slide aross the seat . Build Quality is GREAT but the interior has less toy for people to fiddle with . The GPS doesn't comes with standard , no cruise control ,no traction control, no auto folding mirror ,rear passenger air-con is weak . But the air-con has a special plasma cluster to clean the air , so the car smell good , my car still smell like new . Overall is pretty great , no repair at all since gotten the car . Service it regularly . This car is very safe comes with both driver and passenger airbag , curtain and knee airbag . Rear passenger airbag ! THIS CAR IS FULL OF AIRBAG LIKE THE BMW! The engine is quiet too ! Appearance , this car does look good , one of the reason i brought this car is because of the looks . The exterior styling is elegant a rather aggressive look at the front , the rear styling is rather plain , should come with dual exhaust maybe . The interior styling is abit ""uncle"" not a right styling for young people . Cost of ownership , the fuel consumption is not bad i got the same fuel consumption as my previous civic , i am a heavy footer so i get a higher f/c than average people 9.9km/l . The VVT-i engine like a lion that needs just a mice a day. Maintenance cost is cheap , i like to service it every 5000 km to keep the engine in top notch condition or else service the engine every 10,000 km and you'll be fine . Spare part are cheap and easy to find . Fun Factor , not very fun , but i added a DVD player in the car to kill the boring driving to work . But it's easy to drive fast , cornering is good , just the bodyroll that's killing the fun . This is the right car to bring you to work or long distance trip with a ease of mind ."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Re-sale Value.   Great value and very economical! Beautiful contempoary design and legendary reliabilty at a great affordable price. I have the 4-cylinder LE which is great but if you were to purchase one, I highly recommend the LE V6 or SE model."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Very Good Family Car   THE car is great! it handles well and it accelerates out of the gate like you'd never expect a toyota to do. it is also a great family car for everyone. if you're looking for a family car with a good amount of space then look no further then an '07 camry
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Car For Some, Just Not My Type Of Car   very roomy and comfortable, with a smooth ride. 2.4l 4cyl engine just doesn't have enoughpower for a car this large. Fly by wire throttle has response delay. Sloppy automatic transmission. No repairs needed after 55k miles except for brakes and oil changes. Very good on gas if you're not over 3k miles between oil changes, if overdue, mpg is 22 or so, normally about 28mpg"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Camry Le   Its a zippy car that feels like it has a lot of power but really doesn't put much out when you open her up. It hugs turns pretty well. Its fun to cruise around in with the radio blasting, which has very nice sound quality. Good gas mileage, around 25mpg."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Nice Looking, Comfortable, Hybrid Has Good Power, What More Can I Say, Great!   What a car!

2007,Toyota ,Camry,"07 Camry   Performance: Good acceleration and handling, but braking is a little slow. Build Quality: No repairs needed Gas mileage: Averages about 25 in city, about 30 on highway. Wish Toyota made Camrys in manual, but SE is much more fun to drive than base."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Feels Solid And Well Built. Comfotable Ride   great car I would recommend to anyone,its smooth comfortable,safe and always runs. I have had general motors,Fords and chryslers my whole life.always had quality and performance issues. The Camry has impressed me. I will buy one again.."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,2007 Toyota Camry   I drive it everywhere. The interior is very nice and the sound system is great for stock. It really accelerates and brakes pretty well for a sedan that's not geared towards performance. It gets pretty good gas milage. It's a great everyday driving car. The exterior parts are also fairly cheap. Someone ran into my back bumper and I replaced it for like $350 if i remember right.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"I've Only Driven Camrys For The Past 8 Years. Enough Said.   I love my Camry (except for the scratches, thanks to my son). The SE brings good looks to the best selling car in the world. Had to special request a 5-speed 4-cylinder from Virginia, but it was definitely worth it."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Camry   I like the V6 engine. It is powerful yet fuel efficient. 268 horses make it one quick car. The styling is underrated. You have to see it in person to appreciate the styling. Also it is reliable so you don't have to worry about it breaking down.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Take It From Me; Its Nice.   Not much acceleration; could care less. I've had it for about 2 years and the only thing that has been replaced was the trunk lock. Its a pretty nice ride ;) I bought it in red and it looks like woah, super cool."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Eh   The handling is good, smooth. The acceleration is better than I expected. 9 out of 10 for appearance. No repairs expect a few minor scratches. This car is amazing to drive, i like lookin for people to race with for a quater mile. Ive beaten plently even for a camry"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Care, Just Needs Stronger Carpeting   The camery is very nimble quick on its feet, it handles like a shark in water. the build quality is finaminal, however the interior carpeting is a little short and unreinforced, which can result in your carpet ripping from its bolt attachments. it looks sporty enough for a young person and yet sophistocated enough for a diplomat. it is very well built, so matinence is mostly oil changes and tire rotations, and the mileage is spot on with and average 33.2 mpg in the cith and 37.8 highway. when you want to really feel the road push your foot down just a little more and wow it just puts your ass into the seat, and the bucket seat design with the electronic controls really allow you do go from daily driver to weekend track warrior."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Wife's Joy   It's an overall nice car, but one of the most uncomfortable cars for me to drive. I can handle about 1hr then i'm destroyed. Wife's car so that's fine. good on gas. Car has lots of room in the trunk."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Love It!   I love this car. It has a fantastic quality ride while maintaining a bit of sportiness to keep it a bit fun. There are some squeaks and rattles in the interior, but that's to be expected when you have taken the majority of the interior apart for aftermarket audio products. I love the lines of the body as well. Doesn't look anything like Camry's of old."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Camry Ce   The acceleration of the car is surprisingly very high. I bashed my Camry once, and had to take out a Prius for a couple of days and it was the slowest thing in the world. The interior is amazingly built, but I would prefer the leather seats; still a nice car. Cost for maintenance is low, and I only have 23.235miles on it. Is it fun to drive? YEAH! on the high way it performs great, and it gets around in an urban environment pretty good!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Of All The Cars I Have Owned, This One Is My Favorite Of Them All.   My Camry SE V6 is comfortable, realiable, easy and cheap to maintain, and is a great performance buy with 268 HP, it is fast. The SE suspension package makes it handle very well and it a solid performer on the twisties. The SE appearance package sets my Camry apart and has an aggressive and sporty look that is most attractive and distinctive."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Driving Green   Good solid vehicle that looks good and gets great fuel mileage. I love to drive over 500 miles before I have to stop for fuel. Love the heated seats in the Winter. ALso, love the ability to drive in stealth mode.....drive without the engine running."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"The Spirit Of Lexus Lives...   Reliable, quiet, and comfortable. With 4 cyl engine, this Camary will not break any acceleration records. The braking is sure and smooth and the car handles with decent road feel. Build quality is good with one slight flaw where the dash meets the driver-side AC vent. With leather interior and classic lines, this Camry will be eye pleasing for years to come. Gas mileage is excellent and has no mechanical issues. Perhaps not the funnest car to drive, but that's not what I bought it for."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Caims On Stability And Power   I can find acceleration is very good,braking is moderate but the handling is very fine although I have claims on its power and stability when I compared it by acar in the sane class which is HONDA Accord the last one have gorgeous stability and power but I'd like the shpae of Camry rather than Accord About maintenance its very easy but although it has VVTi system but I can say it;s not a gas saver at last I hope u enjoy ur drive"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Camry   The 2007 Camry LE is a great car all around. Plenty of room for 4 adults, I especially appreciate the rear passenger leg room. We have yet to find anything too big for the trunk. The fit and finish leaves something to be desired, two tone interior as well as textured door panels make it tolerable, but it is no Lexus. The performace is exactly as one would expect from a 4 cyl FWD sedan. The 5 speed trans helps acceleration and mileage a tad by providing an extra gear, but when you want to push it a little, it doesn't know what to do. It was programmed with shift patterns to optimize economy, not performace. That combined with a soft suspension and steering take away any temptation to drive it like a sport sedan, which is fine because it isn't. The LE package does however offer nice compensation for the lack of thrill, all power doors and windows and cruise are a given, power driver's seat is standard as well as the ability to connect and i-Pod right to the factory stereo, color keyed mirrors and door handles, keyless entry with a power operated trunk and an ambient air temp sensor so you know how cold it is outside. Over all I love the car and it serves it purpose very well."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Great Car   Excellent quality vehicle with lots of cool features. Great JBL audio quality with 6CD. Passenger side climate control. Nice interior with teak colors. Driving was far more smoother than I thought. Sometimes you won't even feel the speed. Recommend this car to anyone.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Toyota Camry Se   Very floaty ride, not good in snow, hard to parallel park due to blind spot, rattles in dash, seats not comfortable. Exterior is good looking but interior and ride a huge disappointment. I can't believe this is rated so high, people have really lowered their standards"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Toyota Camry   This Toyota was bought from the same dealer I had bought my Hilux from 20 years earlier and I sold the pickup to buy the Camry. This car has more stock horsepower than most standard V-8 cars. The finish inside and out is excellent. The little things like fasteners and covers are well hidden and tight. The car goes like a jack rabbit and handles like a sportscar. The breaking system is excellent in the rain. I had to make a panic stop when I was cut off in the rain and it stopped straight and true all the way down to zero. The milage could be better, but having a lead foot doesn't help either"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Le Camry   Its good on gas without sacrifise rooms or much speed.Has good handling and braking just wish it hand better acceleration. so far i have not had to make any repairs. It is a good looking car in must colors darker is better i think. I think i paid to much but that is just my own personal feeling.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Why Did I Buy This?   i got this car because of the good luck my friends have had with toyota. well all i can say is that i have not there luck. this car handles horribly, build quality is not up to snuff, and the cars is butt ugly. this car has had a ton of transmission problems. is this toyota quality? back to honda i suppose."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Camry Hybrid   For once I was ahead of the curve, a little bit anyway. The car is fun to drive. The electric motor gives you instant power off the line. In spite of what the literature says, the car gets it's best gas mileage in cruise, on the highway at about 70 mph. Fit and finish were great. We bought the upgrade with heated leather seats, fancy stereo and navigation system. One of my few gripes is the power seats don't have a memory function (something that is on our 1998 Volvo) so you have to reset the seats every time the driver changes."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Love It !!   Amazing braking, handling Build Quality is owesome!! both interior and exterior styling id nice!! gas mileage is good, maintenance is minimal !! This car is fun to drive.......Cost of ownership is not that bad...!! Best Performance, Build quality, Appearance, and fun to drive.................i guess this is an enough review for a damm car!!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Bless Girl!   I love this car I got it right off the showroom floor what a blessing its really a stylish sports car, smooth drive good on long distance driving for gas city not! The 6 disc cd changer awesome. Very easy to handle braking system on of the best. I love this car"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Absolutely Love My Camry   In October 2007 I traded my 2005 Toyota Avalon in on this Camry. Best move I ever made. It has all the bells and whistles. The deal I got was a zero percent lease. I love the bluetooth feature for my phone and actually thought I would never use the navigation but have found I have used it and it came in handy.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Daryl's Camry   It's faster than a 3 Series, uses regular unleaded and gets great gas mileage. What's not to like about a Camry? Luxury to me is all about reliability."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,I Love This Car. Great Gas Mileage And Comfortable.   it gets 34 miles/gallon highway...which is awesome. my parents take my car on trips instead of theirs haha. has a ton of room in it. my dad and brother can ride in the back seat comfortable and they are 6 ft tall. easy to handle and has plenty of get up and go.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Affortable   I drive this vehicle because it is affortable and because I drive far to go to work it is practicle.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Strong Vehicle, Not Too Fast, But Reliable   Vehicle is built solid, looks decent, and very spacious. Cons are it looks rather bulky, many blind spots, slow acceleration."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Amazing Looking   Metallica grey is just such a good looking color in the sun light, the interior is perfect and over all a great car for anyone....way nicer than my 06 scion xb!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Not A Granpa Car Anymore.   I drove this car for chicken delivery and I have to say that I was quite surprised with it. The interior styling is really eye catching. Like that nice greenish color around the radio, the way the dash ends to the center console, the electroluminescent cluster... It's a cool car. The exterior is also surprising and has nothing to do with the old style camry that had this boring style witch my grand father liked by the way..."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Exceeded My Expectations   I wanted a practical car that would be fun to drive and this Camry has not disappointed. It has all the trappings and comforts of a family sedan but when I tromp on the accelerator, I have to hold on tight because this V6 really rocks. Gas mileage hasn't been quite as good as advertised but overall I am averaging over 20 mph. The ride is quiet and comfortable and the handling, while not crisp, is solid and predictable. A much cheaper and exciting alternative to the Lexus ES 350, which I also considered buying."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Couldn't Own A Better Car!   2007 Camry SE, 6-disc JBL audio surround sound, sports pedals, 18'' alloy wheels with Michelen High Performance tires, blackout sports grille, chrome tipped exhaust, exterior: black, interior: ash/black sports interior, spacious trunk, airbags: knees for driver, side impact driver and passager front & back seats, moonroof"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Value For Money And Its Just Gourgeous And An Excellent Drive   This car is value for its money. Not only is it attractive, it is very spacious on the inside. Good performance, smooth handling makes this the best car that I have ever driven"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Its A Best Seller But Is Highly Over Rated   Don't get me wrong Toyota did a good job on the redesigned Camry. Styling is attractive especially on the SE models, Build Quality still appears to good, THough there appears to be a problem with the power drivers seat motor and something bangs whenever the trunk is closed att 8,000 miles. The car is huge inside and all controls are logically placed and refined to the touch. Everything is great untill you drive the car. Don't get the 4cyl 5 speed auto combination, you will be disappointed its extremely jurky, it is impossible to accelerate or turn corners smoothly in this car. The transmission is usually either to slow to respond or the engine is to eager. A big problem in my opinion. The steering is also too light and lacks feel. If u like driving don't buy this car. The highway ride is smooth however, in the city though it can get a little giggly. Its a good car but I would suggest to check out GM before buying."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,A Nice Riding Highway-cruiser  
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"A Nice Riding Highway-cruiser   I bought this car and promptly drove it to Florida. I put 10,000 miles on it in 4 months. The Camry Hybrid is a very nice car, with lots of interior room and a clean, modern design. The hybrid powertrain is imperceptible to all but the trained ear. The CVT transmission is smooth. I did not have the navigation system, so I relied on the instrument cluster readouts for my mileage estimates and hybrid system information. The blue-glow center console is also unique. I traded this car in after just 4 months because it is too big for me. Being a 29-year old guy, it just doesn't cut it - plus I like driving manuals and this doesn't cut it. I was also disappointed with the small trunk. It's a big car with limited cargo-carrying capability. I averaged between 31 and 45 MPG. I could eeke out a tank at 40-45 mpg is I was super light on the gas, with no A/C on and keeping speeds pretty constant in the 65 mph range. It looks much better than the Accord, in my opinion, as well."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Nice Car But Faulty Transmission   I4 Automatic Transmission. Been having serious acceleration delay and dealers won't seem to help. There is a TSB out for this and have been reading and meeting a lot of people complaining about this issue.
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Our Newest Baby...   So far the ride is awesome! We love the comfort, the seats hug you! We love it's stylish look too!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Nice Car   the car looks really good reiable handles very well but acceleration is not that good
2007,Toyota ,Camry,Great Deal   278hp@6200 rpm 17 inch wheels 6 speed tip tronic gear front wheel drive
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"This Is An Okay Car But Not In Love With It.   We bought our Camry the first month they were available. We now have over 64,000 thousand miles on it. To be fair, we have not have any real trouble with it. We replaced the tires at 60K. The factory tires lasted well. The car is not comfortable for either one of us. I am 5-10 and my wife is 5-2. The seats just don't fit well. (this may be just us) The biggest complaint is the noises that are in the front end of the car. They make us crazy! The road noise is bad enough and then there are rattle noises that come and go. We also have a high pitched vibration in the front end passenger side. We have taken it to Toyota to repair to no avail. I swear that the sounds are phantoms that move around. The mileage is good at 30mpg. We have the 4 cyl and yet it gets better mileage at 80 than at 65. It kills me to ride more than a few hours in this car. I bought the Toyota heavy use rubber floor mats and the front one has worn through already. Overall the car is Okay. I bought a Toyota because they are known as great cars. I am not wow'ed. It's just another car. At $25,000 maybe I was expecting too much from it. I though it would be a quite, solid, well designed car. The radio light is way to bright at night. Just little things like that."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 4 Cly Camry Is Junk   Bad hesitation/downshifting problem. car shakes at stop lights, paint falls off front bumper, toyota says when YOU see hill comming to turn off cruise control because car san not see hill comming, and toyotas attitude, nothing I can do,because toyota can do as they please. replace transmission and new one does same thing, problem becomes ""normal""???? maybe like oil sludge problem toyota will do something when made to!!!"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"I Love This Car   I used to drive a subaru forester. Don't get me wrong I loved the car but I have been converted to the toyota. It is such a nice ride, noiseless and plenty of room."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"It Is Smooth And Wonderful Experience   I have just done about 130Miles on the car, it is woderful so far. However, i feel it is too light for its size and capacity, particularly when compared with competition of the same capacity."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Camry 4 Dr Xle 2.4l Review   Has more pickup than my 1994 Camry (both are 4 cylinder); however, it's not as quiet on the road (engine noise is greater). This I don't appreciate. Also I was dissapointed that the rear seats didn't fold down like my '94 did. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with the overall looks and performance."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Complaint   I have been driving camery since 98. I also drove a 2003 and then now 2007. The acceleration is horrible. I really feel it is dangerous especially when you are trying to get speed and the performance in accelerating speed is very hesitate. I took it back to the dealer ship and was told that this was find, but there is no where way this car should be doing this. My intension was tohave this car for at least 10 years this time, but there is no way I can keep this car. I wish now I had kept my 2003, which only had 37,000 miles on it."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great, Fuel Efficient Mid-sized Sedan.   Great car overall! I love the low operating costs. Drives nice and has plenty of room for passengers as well as a large trunk space. The 2 front air bags and 4 side curtain air bags are a nice safety feature."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Reliable Family Car   reliable, quiet, spacious, good looking (better than previous or later versions of Camry). toyota takes care of the customers, the 2007 camry has seen 3 recalls at no charge to customer: 1. gas pedal 2. sun visor replacement 3. to replace the entire dash board cover"
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Indeed A Car For Those Who Just Don't Care.   I drive this car from time to time because it's my mother-in-law's car. The car is in its basic form with 2.4 I4 engine mated to a 5 speed automatic transmission. Pro of this car is listed in the ""pro"" section of this review, and I won't go into details because it's straightforward. Now, the 'con's. The steering is completely uncommunicative and numb. And there's quite a bit of play, so it's annoyingly difficult to even drive in a straight line in the highway. Not to mention, the steering wheel itself seemed to have been shaped to purposely cause discomfort to your hands. The whole car wallows about in braking and cornering, so that's all I have to say about suspension and chassis, but at least it gives you a decent ride as a side-effect. The throttle has a mind of its own and so does the cruise control. The transmission is geared so tall between 4 and 5 that if you set cruise to any more than 73mph, and you happen to encounter a slight slope, the transmission will shift to 4th (due to lack of power from the engine) and the noise and vibration caused by it will certainly wake your baby who was sleeping comfortably in the backseat. And finally, the interior trim pieces don't align properly and they feel much cheaper than the competitors. PS. If you happened to buy this car in the V6 trim, you won't have to worry about the transmission, throttle, cruise control issues, because the powerful engine will eliminate all the woes related to those parts."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Camry   This is NOT VERY GOOD and NOT VERY BAD car ever. Think about the diamond- is placed at somewhere centre. Performance - normal acceleration responding, appropriate breaking with ability for standard driving, too light weight from steering wheel but easy to control Build quaility - everything is ok, except of shork ab shovers... they just work about 70000km. after that, rattles came from underneath... I just replaced shork abs (not a whole, but partly replaced). little squeaks from dash... ki kik ki kik...sounds... Appearance - standard looks, I got silver color. LE model has normal grill...SE looks better. Fuel efficiency exceeds its appeared official fuel record, and exhausts more gas than I expect, especially for intense accelerating. To conbine city and hwy driving, 10km/ liter. (urban/ rural) average.... Not fun to drive, but works silently. constantly... This is sedan for a family use or person who likes quiet and silence drving. worth to buy... will work until 300,000km..."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Car-sometimes Too Sport Oriented For A Family Car-sometimes Too Family Oriented 4 Sportier Car.   Performance-Acceleration and Braking is almost too much if you are not familiar with the car, Handling is perfect (The utmost feel of the road and solid firm feeling or maneuverability and quick body movements). Build Quality-It has never needed repairs, however the interior materials seems to be put together poorly. Appearance-The outside appearance is great; Interior could use help on Rear Cup holders and the front center air vents don't flow well into the dash. I love the minimization of the controls. The way the headrests flow into the body of the seat look cool. Cost-Great Fuel Mileage, 28 AVG (24city, 32hwy) Change oil every 7,000 miles. Fun Factor-Can be fun to drive but the seats really need more side support to incise someone to actually do so."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Quality And Good Features   Good leather, SLT Hybrid trim nice and Hybrid offers good gas mileage and quite ride. That is why I would suggest the Toyota Camry. The in dash navigation and 4 disc changer along with onboard computer will impress the friends."
2007,Toyota ,Camry,"Great, Fuel Efficient Mid-sized Sedan.  "
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Okay   It is not perfect but it does its job and does it well. Burns oil but Toyota says that is normal. radio doesn't pick up a lot of stations. All of this can be verified on forums. I have had since it was new and have put 140k mi. on the thing. It works and I would purchase again.
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Car !   Gas saver , lots of space, maintenance and repair costs fair. I feel safe and in control driving it. No noises and had no issues with the vehicle performance. Overall a Great Family Car or for a single on the road a lot ."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2008 Camry Se   i like this car very much runs well but feels kind of light on the road is not as driving a ford fusion the fusion feels very strong and handles well on the road is like driving a bmw, or a m-benz."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Overall Reliable   Car is a great car, just need something bigger and automatic.Only did required services and recently changed the tires. All in all this car is very reliable. Other than routine maintenance nothing else was required. I also put rims and wider tires which ade the handling a bit better."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"I Loved This Car.   I used this car for my daily commute as well as several long trips. I'd set the cruise control at 10 MPH above the speed limit, and relax. Traffic jams became a matter of pride as I knew that my engine would shut off when I wasn't moving. (Ironically, the Camry Hybrid gets BETTER fuel economy in stop and go driving that it does cruising the highway at 65 MPH. It's all in the way the Synergy Drive System works.) I enjoyed saving money on gas while remaining relatively anonymous in my normal looking car. As a nice bonus, Massachusetts allows you to travel in the HOV lane without passengers if you are driving a hybrid. Also, the Hybrid Only spaces at the Boston Common garage are usually available and in a primo location :-) The car has plenty of power (I used to jokingly say to my passengers ""that's TWO engines"" when I'd have to accelerate to merge in traffic or for some other reason. The handling is fine, once you get used to it. This car is not for a slalom course, it's for driving to work in comfort. The braking is different from a non-hybrid. The car is slowed by regenerative braking until you get down to 12 MPH, in regular situations. So the brakes get almost no wear if you brake slowly and smoothly. In a panic the regular brakes kick in immediately and stop you in plenty of time. This is a fantastic car. I'm replacing it with a newer hybrid and wanted to sell it while there is still plenty of miles left on it for the next owner."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Love The Sporty Image   Paint job on the white Camrys have major problems. Love the interior of the SE models and the spoilers that keep it from looking like a grandpa car. Sunroof is also a great addition on these cars. Gotta love Toyotas-my 98' Corolla is still going strong!
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Hybrid Just Not Worth It Yet   The car is a great car but I feel we would have been just as happy with a non-hybrid car. Actually may have been more happy since a big portion of trunk is lost to battery cooling. The car is now running in mid 30's for fuel economy which could easily be done with a diesel car and not the extra cost upfront from the battery. If you are looking for best fuel economy, diesel is still king. If you want to save the earth, remember the nickel in the battery is mined in canada, transported to Europe to be made into the battery, then shipped to the US or Japan to be assembled. If you recycle the car when you are done you still have consumed more energy than you saved."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Cam Review   i wud prefer the honda accord if i cud afford it.......better option than corolla though.corolla tends to waiver on the road especially during heavy wind!!overall the camry is a fun car to be in!!beats our indian ambassador though
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Suitable Car With High Performance And Low Cost   Performane : ABS Brakes , Power Stearing , Very Fast Car , Accelerate Quickly . Appearance : The Car is rated as a High Class Car from Inside . From outside it has a fantastic , modern style . Cost of Ownership : It is very economical car in gas mileage , But the maintenance is very costy . Fun Factor : I think the car isnt too funny , It's somehow Stylish."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Car For The Money,   I just picked up a 08 Camry XLE with a V6. It is a wonderful car and I love the way it feels on the road. Mine has everything except keyless and navigation. This is my first Toyota, I chose the brand for it's reputation of reliability and the Camry is the size of car I was looking at. I wanted a sedan that has some performance and I sure got it, I really like this car."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"If You Like Camry's Get A Volkswagen. Their Less Stressful.   I hate the fact i get only 25 MPG. I hate the way the car rattles when stopped. I like the powers seats that don't move up and down anymore. I have a busted trunk latch, the cover for the A pillar fell on my lap yesterday. everything was glued together so everything fall off at once. Squeaks while stepping on the gas peddle. Ugly front end, looks like a 1999 Camry in the back end. This car is about 10K from needing a new trans. I hope to trade this thing in soon so some other sucker can say oh crap."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Mi Auto Favorito   This is a great car. The exterior styling is definetly awesome. Interior is very roomy and comfortable. The controls on the dashboard are well designed and easy to use. The JBL Audio system is just terrific. Steering wheel mounted audio controls are sweet. Excellent stability and perfect aerodynamics. Fun to drive. Handles very well even in windy conditions and in torrential pouring down rain.
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2008 Camry Se   I liked my Camry, but there were a few things that bothered me. The engine was underpowered and had a bad hesitation when you put the gas pedal to the floor. Some of the trim was poorly chosen, and gets scuffed up very easily. The car was very comfortable to drive/ride in. My biggest complaint was I didn't trust the car when merging with traffic or passing someone, sometimes when you hit the gas, the engine would barely get above an idle. In my opinion that can be dangerous."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"A Good Buy In The End   Well its got a good acceleration, and much more stable at higher speeds than an accord. Steering feels a little numb or slow. the hand brake (leg brake) is annoying I'd definately prefer if it were actually a hand brake."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Try Not To Scratch The Bumpers..   Awesome car to drive in this segment! Way better than the previous models...Oh and very spacious interior! The power and handling are realy good..Responsive engine wid matching brakes..Neat design,the ground clearance is slightly low but that matches up for stable handling above 200km/h."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Buy   Pretty quick for large car, very spacious , good sound system, good mileage , great pickup, not enough power though and options are a bit crummy. Not much required to own one. The car is really fun to drive and very cheap."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Dream Driving Mechaine Of The Decade.   Revolution in toyota industry up to standard of Honda and BMW by performence and styling. Cost effective, fuel effecient, ultimate exterior, impressive handling and stability with excellent braking system, power on the road, easy to maintain. Comfortable and stylish interior, excellent cooling system and sound system with plenty of space and a big back trunk with a lots of space. So in short plent of style, comfort,power and saftey with cost and fuel effectiveness. Its the car of the decade for family use."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2008 Toyota Camry Le 4cyl.   Reliable-Boring, Slow-Boring,Styling-Boring. This is a good car. A logical choice for consumers but I hate boring cars. When you own a car it says something about who you are. This can says nothing. It drives good gets incredible mileage, and even smells nice on the inside. I hate how Toyota designs things so only their mechanics can work on them."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"I Recommend To Buy Such Car If You Are Older Than 30 Years   It's very nice and very practical car, almost maintinance free, the stabilityof this car is not very good specially when you drive above 160 k/m. it's veru popular here in saudi arabia, and the re-sale value is realy high."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Best Car   The acceleration is great, braking handling is all good. Well it is a strong car. Well the exterior of the car is slim stylish look, very aerodynamic. The interior is very simple but elegant. Maintenance is good and mileage. Overall a great car."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Gas Mileage And Performace.   Now this is what driving was meant to be. Great gas mileage, a lot of power and many comforts. If you want a car that gets over 33mpg with many averages up in the 38-40mpg area then this is the car for you."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Its An Ok Car   performance is ok,build quality is not so bad either,appearance is really nice and its roomy,its quite economical to own,its a fun car to drive..no rear ac vents,and no flourescent head lamps to comlement it"
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Very Cost - Effective   I love the way it drives especially only being 4 cylinders and a hybrid to boot! The gas mileage is outstanding. Well worth the cost for the hybrid. I save in gas! Fun to drive? Oh yeah! Even has a little bit of luxury added to it!
2008,Toyota ,Camry,I Love It!   Accelerates like a race car! Gets good gas mileage. Drives very well and the ride is very smooth. Cost is good...it's a lease. Fun to drive. Handles very well even in windy conditions and in torrential pouring down rain.
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"'08 Toyota Camry   Performance- acceleration: terrible braking: sketchy handling: okay Build Quality- it sounds like a tin can if you hit a dirt road. flick it; it feels like plastic. of course, it is. Appearance- Interior: nice, velvety seats, the radio screen is cheap. Exterior: looks-wise, very smooth. Cost- gas: very cheap, nice mileage maintenance: eh since most of it you can do yourself, unlike mercedes or bmw, it's fairly cheap. Fun Factor- for an automatic, it's fun as far as the styling of the exterior goes; otherwise, this car sucks."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"I Love My Camry   I love everything about my Toyota Camry SE V6. It's fast, sporty, and gets great gas mileage. I love the interior amenities, and the exterior (mine is barcelona red) is cool looking (it doesn't hurt that I opted for the ground effects kit, rear spoiler, and chrome kit) So far this is the best car I have owned, and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they opted for the V6 engine. I would never consider the 4 cyl. that engine it seems has some performance issues."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"My Reliable Camry 08   A nice stable, reliable car. Nothing fancy, but I love it's slave-like reliability. Performance _ acceleration is very good on the V6, braking is also very effective, handling is decent Build Quality _ there's more to be desired in this area Appearance _ both interior and exterior styling is great Cost of Ownership _ gas mileage, maintenance, and longevity are all great incentives for not buying German Fun Factor _ the car is fun to drive compared to US makes, but German cars are in a different league."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2008 Toyota Camry Se I4   I Love EVERYTHING about this car! Steering response is phenomenal, build quality is top of the line. Everything works perfectly. Acceleration could be a lot quicker but then again it IS a Camry haha. ONE of TWO ONLY downsides to this car might be that it is quiet bulky for a full-size sedan..maybe just a hint larger but maybe it's just be me. And TWO, the car comes with factory installed Bridgestone Turanza EL400's. I have to point out that these tires are HORRIBLE! Dry traction is good but when put to the test in different conditions this vehicle will not stick to the road. I'm in the process of buying new wheels and tires for my baby. Gas mileage (to me) is just a hint over the downside edge. A full 18.5 tank would cost me roughly around $65 where I am. I am a spirited driver so I know those short bursts of acceleration takes it's toll on my gas, not to mention the desire to stay 9mph above the speed limit lol. I also like to go out a lot which would explain my trips to the gas station at exactly every week. This car isn't for those of you who LOVE SPEED and do it 24/7, but it if you're one of those ""spirited drivers"" and find yourself speeding once in a while, this car will more than exceed your expectations. Though it doesn't come in a manual tranny for the Gen6, it does have a 5-Speed Auto tranny which would somewhat satisfy your desire to ""shift between gears"". The SE comes with a ground effects kit which makes the car look as if it's been dropped (+1). This car only has a little less than 4,000 on it so I can't say if the brakes squeak or if there's a problem with anything..too soon to say. I would recommend this car to ANYONE! LOVE IT!"
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Good-looking Car Made My The Most Reliable Car-makers On The Planet.   The only problem I would say is that some of the parts look cheap, but the quality overall is Toyota worthy. Another MAJOR problem that I encountered was visibiliy: the two columns in the front that connect the roof to the rest of the car make turning somewhat dangerous at night since they block a good portion of the view if you're tall."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,In Today's Gas Prices Its The Best Power Packed Car.....   its the best car in the category....love the zip it has...the performance...intelligence...
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Awesome   Great all around car.Good get up and go.0-60 -8-9 sec. Quiet ride.Smooth shift.Very Spacey. Gas Mileage is great for a big car. 22-24 city/34-36 highway. Just as Big as a Ford Crown Vic,Lincoln TownCar, and the Mercury Grand Marquis."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,Great Family Car   i love it but it is just not for me right now... i would rather have a sports car
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Toyota Camery Is A Great All Around Car.   my step mother bought the v-4 automatic. its a wonderful car, very spacious and lots of get up and go for a 4 banger. toyota is the next big thing, one of the few that is no longer building disposable cars."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Love It   Great car for the buy. Will last forever. Fast, Great suspension. Good Gas miles. Sporty"
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"A Big, Fierce Lookin' Camry That Lacks The ""usual"" Build Quality!   Tough Looks. Stands out as the biggest & roomiest in its class. Engine & transmition RoCk! Handling & braking needs alot of improvement. Very ""plastic"" interior is of poor quality & feels cheap."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Like Lexus Qualities   There is quite a bit of the 2008 Toyota Camry that reminds me of it's upscale cousin Lexus. The Materials, Fit and Finish, Technology, Luxury,Design and Performance are outstanding. I was extrememly impressed with the high amount of standard equpiment.- Most of it being highend advanced technology. From the moment the engine is started, you feel elevated among the other cars. The Camry gives such a smooth, sophisticated ride you forget that you're not in a high end luxury sedan. This is especially true when soft leather, various metallic accents, gleaming chrome, highly pollished wood grain, push button start, fancy nav system, and more come together seamlessly. The Toyota Camry is an outstanding car. You certainly know where the Lexus ES 350 came from."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Ride Overall.   The suspension is a bit too stiff for my tastes. When one thinks of the Camry, one associates it with a ride that is the envy of any other car in this class. This is true of the CE, LE, XLE, and Hybrid trims. The SE has a sport tuned suspension that results in improved handling prowess, but also thumps a bit more over bumps. The ride is still supple and competitive with many sedans, but you don't get the bump absorption like in the other Camry models. The fit and finish of the Domestic Camry models have been inconsistent. The interior plastic is mostly good, but some panels look and feel budget grade. There are a few inconsistencies in panel gaps. Overall, it is good overall. But American Camry models have had recent uncharacteristic lapses in interior workmanship, that is very unToyotalike."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"It Rocks!   What? I already said it,it rocks!!"
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Not As Boring As Some Say....   I love the power in this car - plenty of it that just keeps coming when you press the accellerator hard. I don't really know why some people keep saying it's a boring car. Sure the 4-cyl might be boring but this V6 is always fun to drive. Build quality is great, BUT the interior paneling's new design (sharp edges) causes bad fit all over the place. The transmission does this funny thing that early 2007's did - it slips from 2-3 (rpm jumps 200-600) but only when accelarating very slightly, like in traffic. Dealer couldn't duplicate it and said this 2008 already has the newest firmware and that they can't see why it would do it. Also, downshifts are sometimes hard, but only when one hesitates when suddenly accelarating and then backing off again. 4420 miles driven in 4 months. Gas mileage varies a lot - when doing mostly city driving I get 19 mpg and when mostly freeway I get 27-28 mpg."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"My Favorite Car   Just got this beauty. Its a great car for a women. Very good MPG,handles great even in winter conditions,very soft ride,gorgeous body and enterior. Cannt get better new car with that price tag."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Solid Car!!!   This is a great car. The exterior styling is definetly awesome. Interior is very roomy and comfortable. The controls on the dashboard are well designed and easy to use. The JBL Audio system is just terrific. Steering wheel mounted audio controls are sweet. Although the ride is very smooth and solid, the engine lacks power especially when merging onto freeway. Told the dealership about this and a sevice technician test drove the car and felt it. They said some ""08 camry 4cyl"" owners are experiecing this same issue. They said that Toyota is aware of this issue and will have a remedy soon. So I'm waiting for them to release the fix. But regardless this is a sweet car."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2007 Motor Trend Car Of The Year   I love it and it is vrey room and i fit my family in there with no problems. Guys sorry, this is a woman's car...i smerk at men that drive this car...girls get the V6...it is the bomb...but look out for the POPOs"
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Car - For An Adult.   I just drove this yesterday as a reward for a job-well-done in negotiating and purchasing start to finish for a relative. I took it for a spin and it was nice. Not responsive enough for my tastes, but is a solid and well built machine. Great features - Nav, Bluetooth, etc - but lacks the presentation. Its interior isnt anything great, even while fully loaded. Maybe they have a wood-trim package that I missed out on. Great car for an adult looking for safety and reliability. Better looking body that previous years. Just not blown away."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Hot Car Feels Like A Real Sports Sedan   Well just got the car two days ago so this is a short review. The car feels very solid and seating is very good with great support for some of us older people with a tired back. The power is great 0-60 is a rocket ride with enough G Force to make you grin from ear to ear. No rattles no squeeks. The suspencion is a true sport type so you do feel a few bumps. The car is very solid however and a bump lets you know you are sitting on an agressive package.I can hardly wait to road trip this cool ride. Oh and it still feels classy so when i have my suit on I think I can pull up to the vallet and they will still call me sir. I have not had time to set all the functions on the sound and phone system but the basic cell operation worked well just pair your phone settings to Blue Tooth and with a voice command you can say ""my baby""and chat her up with out ever taking your hands off the wheel. So for the future thrill I rate the Camary SE as killer dude. For the classy side a night at the opera and every one riding with us sees Phantom in style. So for a near 60 guy who has loved sports cars all his life way cool. For the kid in me killer dude. And for class ""Bond"" James Bond."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Excellent Car!   I have an '08 Camry XLE, and I absolutely love the car. The redesign in '07 made some huge advances to the car's interior features. The navigation system works well and the touch screen is very user friendly. The odometer/instrument panel is much like the Lexus's now in that it's blacked out until the car is on. This car has tons of head space (I'm tall), leg room, cup holders, and storage compartments! I love the AUX jack for my iPod, and though it is not extremely easy to access, it's placement near a power outlet is ideal. The 8-speaker JBL sound system is amazing and produces quality audio at any volume. The pollen filter is another feature that I will appreciate come Spring. One of my favorite features of this car is the rear window shade. Although manual, it is a huge comfort feature for rear-seat passengers and helps to keep the car cooler while sitting in the sun. The back seat is great for passengers with plenty of leg room, rear air vents, cup holders, reading lights, and (extremely cool) reclining rear seats. The downside to having the reclining seats is that they eliminate the folding rear seat -- leaving you with only a small pass through for a broomstick. This is a great-looking car. The Camry has been bland since the late 90's redesign, but has finally come back around. The only real interior complaint I have is that the instrument panel and navigation unit are too bright at night. You can adjust both (independently), but it isn't convenient to do, and you would need to adjust back for daytime use. Tying this in with the auto headlight sensor and adding an auto dimmer would be nice. The moonroof's auto open/close feature is a nice extra and though I don't have a wind deflector, the moonroof stops short of being completely open to reduce wind noise. I will openly admit to not knowing much about what's under the hood, but I have already experienced a slight issue with the transmission. When merging into interstate traffic, there is a much-to-long hesitation before accelerating (after pushing the gas pedal) - causing scary, potentially dangerous moments. Check out some owner reports at www.nhtsa.dot.gov , and test this out during a test drive! Other than this, the 4 cl. engine is quite powerful and the car handles well and is quiet. These are my opinions/observations after 1 month and 1,000 miles in this car."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Smooth And Swift   This car has been extremely reliable and pulls really good for 268 hp. The fuel for her is very good, especially now with gas being so low, about $25 every week or 2 weeks depending on how much I drive. The car is extremely comfortable and roomy, excellent for long drives."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"Excellent Blend Of Comfort And Economy   She likes it so far, although the seat is not as good as her old Lexus. We will see how it holds up, our previous hybrids have done well. This one is much more comfortable. Good power with the electric assist. We had an issue with the brakes recently. The lights came on and alarms screamed and scared her to death. When I took it to my mechanic the next day I could feel the brakes engaging although I wasn't doing it. When I got to the shop the left front wheel was warm. The mechanic said the code said ""low pressure in the accumulator"" in the brake actuator and maybe I should take it to the dealer. While he was backing out of the garage very slowly, the brakes engaged on their own, then the lights all went off and the alarm stopped and it's been fine ever since. The dealer said everything looked good, and they wouldn't advise do anything. A new actuator is $2800.00 for the part alone.So we are just driving it. Might have been a computer glich, no one seems to know. Update: They had a recall for a brake problem, it only messed up that one time. We have grown to like it very much, my Prius's seats are not as comfortable for a long trip, the mileage is under 40 MPG but still very good. I can see why Consumer Reports ranks it #1."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"2008 Camry Hybrid: Reliability Redefined   I am the proud new owner of a 2008 Camry Hybrid and I could not be more thrilled. Coming from a college student that was driving a 1996 Honda Accord for quite awhile, this is quite the upgrade for me. First things first, in my opinion, Toyota is the staple of consistency within the American auto market. For 75 years, this company has been creating quality products that have served customers all over the world. The Camry in particular was the best selling car in the United States from 1997-2013, an incredible feat that proves that Toyota holds a significant share of the products on the road today. The inception of hybrid technology has revolutionized what people look for when they buy a car. As gas prices continue to rise, car buyers are increasingly conscious about how much money they want to spend when filling up their tank. A solution to this issue is investing in a vehicle equipped with hybrid technology. The 2008 Camry is a perfect example of a great car that is not only efficient with MPG's but also stylish, full of great features, and incredibly reliable. Now, as a new hybrid driver, I am still learning the tricks of the trade. It's a different style of driving if you are really trying to maximize your miles per gallon. For starters, Toyota provides the driver with multiple ways to monitor your ""MPG performance"" by showing you a consumption gauge, your average MPG, and even an interactive bar graph that charts how you are doing on your current trip. It is really pretty nifty, and has sparked my competitive side as I always push myself to get the best MPG possible. So, if you enjoy watching yourself save money, this might be the car for you. From a styling standpoint, the 2008 Camry is somewhat conservative, but with the right packages it pulls off a sporty look. 16-inch alloy wheels come standard, and are somewhere between plain and sharp. My vehicle in particular features a 'Super White' exterior with a rear spoiler and dual exhaust. I would recommend adding the spoiler despite the extra cost, as it really adds to the visual appeal of the car. The interior largely depends on which package the Camry is equipped with. Although you pay a decent amount more, the nicer package is worth every penny. Most of that expense lies in the navigation system, which makes the hybrid technology that much more interactive. Through the touch screen, you control maps, audio and bluetooth menus. These features add to the experience of owning and driving the car, as you have the ability to get hands-free navigation, telephone, and audio capability. One thing that this car lacks is a USB connection or way to connect smartphones to the audio interface. The easy solution is to get a simple aux cord and connect through the auxiliary port, no big deal. The leather seats are also great, making for a comfortable ride regardless of distance. Keyless ignition, a JBL sound system and heated seats are all other factors that bring the Camry Hybrid closer to being a luxury-type automobile. From a performance standpoint, the Camry Hybrid thrives. It carries a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine, and a separate electric motor to optimize the MPG output. At full strength, the car can reach 187 horsepower, but most often drivers look to find balance between these two engines by implementing driving habits that allow the electric motor to kick in. The Camry Hybrid can be powered on the electric motor alone, but only under speeds less than 30 mph, and light gas applications. On the road, the car drives very smooth and quietly. Some people have noted that the cabin gets almost to quiet while the car is stopped, but I don't agree. Why would you want to hear the roar of your engine, especially if you knew it was costing you money at a red light? As I mentioned above, getting the feel for driving a hybrid takes time and practice. Mainly (and the biggest struggle for me) is that you have to learn to stay off the pedal and coast whenever you can. This is not necessarily a natural thing to do, but when you have meters showing you how much more effective it is to coast into a stop light rather than ride the break, the motivation is vast. On the highway, cruise control is like a best friend. Speed regulation keeps the car at a consistent level of high MPG output, but with your foot on the pedal it makes it hard to stay in the good graces of the 'eco drive level'. Overall, the 2008 Camry Hybrid is a terrific car. For someone exploring the used market of hybrid vehicles I would take this car into serious consideration. Since it is six years old, finding one on a Toyota dealer lot is highly unlikely. The best way to track one down is through websites such as this. I would recommend looking for one that has been well kept with less than 100,000 miles. I hope that you found this review helpful and consider purchasing the outstanding 2008 Camry Hybrid."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"The Best Family Car I Have Owned   Excellent cruising car, gas mileage on the highway usually in mid 30's, fantastic sound system, heated leather seats are really nice in the winter, tinted windows cut down on the glare in the sun, engine is very powerful and has great passing power."
2008,Toyota ,Camry,I Couldn't Have Asked For A Better All Around Car.  
2008,Toyota ,Camry,"I Couldn't Have Asked For A Better All Around Car.   Liked everything. Top of line 4 cyl XLE hits me just right in pampering. Very comfortable seat and ride quality even over rough and worn roads. The economy was especially nice. I averaged a lot of 26 worst case winter short trips and 30/31 all summer, to even an easy 35 mpg's screaming down freeway with family and a/c on. One time I carefully drove it 200 miles and had economy meter at 39.5 mpg's by the time I got there. It still had plenty of power as long as below 80 on Interstate and trying to pass, that was the only time it ""wheezed"" for more power, which isn't necessary to even be there. I should've kept that one for a long, long time. I miss it."

2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Excellent Vehicle, And Tremendous Long Term Value And Reliability !  "
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Camry   I loved this car because it was always the car to take to the store quickly and get back quickly.It also fit all of our luggage when we went to the airport for pickup or drop off. Overall great car to drive work or on a trip.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Great   See ratings Good power. Good reliability. Good fuel economy. Good price. Plenty of space, and I am a taller driver, so that is always important to feel comfortable without having to sacrifice fuel economy by having drive a larger vehicle. Overall just a great car."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"My Favorite Car Ever.   This is a great driving car. Brakes seemed to never wear down but finally replaced them for second time a few thousand miles ago. Smooth riding and quite. Maintenance costs have been very low. Some people express concern about the batteries. A Toyota Dealership in our town warrants the hybrid batteries for life on a new car. I inquired with other make dealerships, and they all say that they have had to replace maybe 3 battery sets. - ever! And they were replaced because of accidents or water damage from driving in a pond. And the acceleration will surprise. It's pretty quick. All in all - a very nice car."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Family Car   I looked for a few weeks when it came time to buy another car. I picked the Camry over the Accord because my friends Accord (2008) is burning engine oil at only 80k miles. I read a lot about the problem and was pretty disappointed because they drive sporty. Well, I'm happy with the Toyota and it was a good price at Leith Toyota in Raleigh. I have it serviced a a Toyota specialist and hope to get many years of service."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"A Review Of My 2009 Toyota Camry   I liked the color, the gas mileage and the way it handled. The only thing that I disliked about my car is the fact that is a 4 cylinder and it don't have the power. Its roomy but yet sporty for 4 door car."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Excellent Vehicle, And Tremendous Long Term Value And Reliability !   What I most like about this car is its ride, comfort, looks, interior layout, space, and fuel efficiency. For a 4 cylinder it also has good acceleration, especially for passing on the highway. The SE package styling REALLY makes a big difference in the looks of the car along with the ride performance, and cornering. It includes a 440 watt JBL stereo and premium JBL speakers which sounds as good as the 550 watt stereo in our Audi. Just a darn nice car, and too bad the new ones went to such a bland style versus this one. The looks of this one won't be dated for a long time to come."

2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Love This Car!   I have driven in Austin, TX traffic and over the road travel for sales. When in Austin, with the stop and go traffic my gas mileage would average 31-32 mpg. In the country/open road when I set my cruise on ~ 62 I get 40 mpg. I loved the inside of my car every time I got in it. I went from an SUV to this car and never felt like I was in a 'tin can' or something little. All the features of the Hybrid from the keyless entry, steering wheel controls and sun roof make owning this care easy with a side of luxury."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Would Recommend To A Friend   All in all very pleased with this 2009 Camry hybrid. Great gas saver with an average of 40 miles per gallon for our family so far. Money saver. Plenty of room for five adults to sit comfortably. Interior design is superb
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"A Car That Will Never Go Out Of Style   if you want to keep a car for more than 10+ years, this is probably one of the best choice you can go for. the Camry has a very high resale value, The car requires very low maintenance and has no know major manufacturer mechanical defects / recalls. one of the few cars that is widely recommended for both single family and bachelor. it's style and elegance far exceeded it's price."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Awesome Family Car   We took it on a number of trip as well as your daily drive. I would say that the cargo space for a vaction is a little tight for a family of 5. We were forced to sell ( note forced ) with the entry of a new little girl bringing the family size up a notch to 6. This was a 5 seater and required us to take 2 cars to travel. Nothing bad to say about the car. It's super dependable and a great family car.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Drive In Style   Smooth ride, great handling, great performance well maintained. Rear spoiler add on, has all the bells and whistles including blue tooth. Mint condition, very reliable vehicle with enough power and style to keep you and your passengers happy. Five star Safety quality!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Very Good Car With No Issues At All   Very satisfied over all with the car. It is reliable, economical and fun to drive. I have had no problems with the car and it never gave me any trouble. I am happy with the power it has and is fuel efficient at the same time. Excellent family car with exceptional comfort."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Update To My Review 4 Years Ago.....   Okay, I am updating my review from a few years ago. I have now had this car since 2008. I still love the keyless entry and comfort of the car. Can't beat the comfort of it or the spaciousness of the interior! I still like the car, but wish I would have not got it in white as it is too plain looking. I hate the quality of the bluetooth as callers can not hear me at all, they say I sound as if I am very far away. This is the second Toyota Camry that I have owned, and must say that I will not be buying a Toyota again. The way Toyota handled the fiasco of the water pump going out does not bode well for them as a company, nor does it reflect the quality on their newer line of cars. They have had so many major recalls recently, one would think they would do what they could to salvage their reputation. I have a strong feeling they will no longer be in the lead of car sells in America. Their quality is not what it used to be in the older Toyotas."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Excellent   a few things only the Toyota certified dealer can repair hence pricey to maintain. We like Toyota regardless. It is a trusted brand by our family! We continue to shop for Toyotas & hoipe to buy Toyotas for many years to come!
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"If Your Son Or Daughter Has Just Got There License. Get One.   Great first car for a kid. We got the 4-Cy which has just a bit more power than my lawnmower and not as quick off the line. The new body style is still head and shoulders better than the previous. Very cost effective from a quality standpoint and I don't think you drive a Camry for ""fun"". If you do? Stay away from the new Z-28"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"So Far, Great Running, Looking, Getting Through Snow, Car.   Color, ride, smooth shifting, appearance. The joy it gives to my wife..This is the best part of the car. One thing I really like about it is how easy it is to change the oil...I really do not drive but keep the maintenance up on it."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Good Car   It is a very good car. It has good fuel economy,braking and acceleration for a saloon. No problems with build quality. Has good interiors and exteriors. Good gas milage and low maintainance cost. The car is fun to drive."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"A Fun Sedan Thats Good To Look At For Any Family   Performance- For the model I drove, it had the I-4 engine. It was not fast, like at all. But that doesnt mean it was fun. The torques come in more in the top end of the RPM's meaning gunning it from a dead stop doesnt do much till about 5 seconds in. Braking is good though, it had no problem braking, without fading, from 100-0. I didnt really get a chance to test the cars handling all that much, but from what i did it felt responsive and a little on the heavy side. Build quality- Its a toyota, it should be fine. All the inside parts sound sturdy and have a more quality orientated feel to them. For example, moving the different dials and switches on it didnt make a cheap feeling noise, nothing did. Appearance- From a 360 degree look, it doesnt look bad at all. Especially for a family sedan. Sure, its no Bentley, but its not supposed to be. The front looks the best out of the whole car. Cost of ownership- no more than a regular toyota sedan. Fun factor- Sure its not fast, its not that agile, but its a fun car to drive for what its supposed to be. Listening to the wine the engine makes above 4,000 RPM is a rewarding sound too and adds to the fun factor."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"It's A Pimped Out Stock Camry With Sport Suspenion Aka Sport Cab   I dislike it only for not being a V6 but a V4 2.4L I like the following; The acceleration & braking are smooth and the handling is outstanding [love this ride]. Being an SE, it has lowed shirts and thus can be tricky while squeezing in a tight spot to park especially one must slow down on the big humps. Interior styling is better than all the other Camry's as it comes only in Royal Black upholstery with white dots [inverted dalmatian]. The gear box doesn't come with XCVT transmission [I really never use it in my dad's Benz] It's very spacious in the back and I still haven't removed the plastic from the seats...all the panels are in black; finished with silver knobs. Exterior styling is phenomenal as it has a black grill in front instead of the chrome grill... got a spoiler, a moon roof, 6-spoke 17"" alloys, body and side skirts, fog lamps & last but not least sport suspensions thats makes the handling smooth at sharp turns... Maintenance is damn good as no major repairs and the mileage is economical Not the best car in low surfaces but ""She gets the Look!!"""
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Buy One   I love my camry because of its unmistakable appearance, great gas mileage and over all utility. The car only has a four cylinder engine, but it has plenty of power. Even though it was recalled for the recent gas pedal issues I am still very confident in the car. Great Quality!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Its An Se...baby...;)   good acceleration, great looks, smooth ride, fair milage, spacious back row seats, good options, quite cabin, good handling, not that xpensive, good suspensions, a bit stiff breaks...u ll love it when u ll drive it...in short its an awesome gr8 lookin sporty car within a middle mans budget...;)"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Toyota Has Lost There Safety Standard For Production Numbers   Problems with the transmission shifting. Replaced transmission . Problems with the accelerator electronics I believe is real problem for Toyota . Not a safe car to drive! Good looking car but looks are only skin deep. Would not recommend this car brand.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Best Selling Luxury Car In Singapore   hmm spacious and nice although the power is not there yet but it has a high top speed up to 210km/h (try before). its a new car and thanks to singapore government. i had to pay almost 70000USD. But overall love it:)
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Comfort + Relaxation + Simple Operation + Reliabilty = Toyota Camry   This is probably the most comfortable car I have ever driven. I love the revvy 2.4L and 5 spd auto. It revs fast and make this car kinda fun to drive around town. The handling is safe, but boring. Its extremely easy to drive. You don't The apperance is pleasent the inside is very nice with greatly improved build quality over the 07s which I was appauled by.Everything is extremely easy to use.

Its everything you appreciate from toyota. toyota seems not to want this car to be anything but a full size Prius and that is a shame. It could be so much more if TRD where allowed to play with it."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Camry   Toyota retains value well, great for re-selling :-) also very smooth car the camry is, over all I give it two thumbs up, only issue I have with the car is it is very common, great car to have if you don't mind having the same car as everyone else in America."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,'09 Toyota Camry   This is one of the best performing cars that I have ever owned. It accelerates without any hesitation and runs so quietly. I have had it for a couple months now and have had no issues with it at all. It came with an awesome bumper to bumper warranty which sets my mind at ease. Awesome mpg in city and out on the highway. Buying this Toyota Camry has been the best decision that I have ever made. Plenty of room inside too and I'm a big girl! lol
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Well-rounded Choice!   Very well rounded automobile with regards to performance, quality, appearance, and cost of ownership. It is a comfortable ride whether on the highway or around town."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"The Beat Around   The beat around. Attracts motorcycles, blood, trucks, doors, people, just to name a few. Has a million scratches. Looks as if it is 10 years old. Drives very nice and barely uses any gas. The one and only NYC beat around"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"P E R F E C T I O N (for A Hybrid)   I enjoy knowing that while in traffic, I am not using the GAS engine. This is about 50% of my commute. No issues with the car nor the hybrid components so far! Love knowing that I am driving a reliable, fun car that is very trendy/sporty all while saving the planet!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Excellent   I bought my 1st new car in 32 years on 4-16-09. I bought a Toyota Camry because of Consumer reports evaluation. I find this car to be excellent except I bought the 4 cylinder which sometimes seems a little noisy some times.I thought my city mileage would be better then 15.63 but I only have 750 miles on the car and Toyota service said it should improve!
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"This Is The Car For You ! The Toyota Camry 6cyl. Se Model   pros ; ' the Cars Overall appearance is stunning, the 6cyl. version (which I posses) has a good mileage percentage whether on the highway or in the city. GAS MILEAGE IS A PLUS! The whole car is nice, I like my roomy trunk area, & the SE (Sports Edition), Is the equivalent of the LEXUS GS300 In Handling & performance for $10,000.00 less. GET WHILE IT'S HOT"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"I Love My 2009 Camry Hybrid   The breaks could be slightly stronger and the usual hybrid acceleration delay is annoying. Will that ever be improved? The navigation system seems confusing, even after reading 2009 Navigation System Owner's Manual and the 2009 Navigation System Quick Reference Guide. Nicely surprisingly, I get an average of 41.8 mpg highway and 38.6 mpg city. I recently drove my car from San Diego to Pittsburgh and that's how I learned this. Additionally, my calculated mpg is almost 10% higher than the displayed mpg. Lastly, the car continued it's great mileage even around the endless hills of Pittsburgh. The interior appearance is better than the exterior appearance. I've had no needed repairs to date and there are no rattles or squeaks. The car is fun to drive but the handling around bends requires allot of attention to avoid going off the road."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Black Love   i feel much at home in my car, but still sorely miss my TUNDRA(my car is not the best in the snow)! i find that people want to drag race me at every stop light! wanna go for a ride?!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"09 Se Overview   This is my 6th car. I have owned American, European, and Japanese. I bought the SE in Sept 08. By far this is the best car I have ever owned. The looks are fantastic. I get compliments from people age 15 to 45, and they all love the looks. Top quality craftmanship and handles like a true sports car should."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Camry   For its size and 4 cylider engine this car has great power and exelent gas milage. The SE model adds a hint sporty flavor with the lowering kit and the tight suspention makes this vehicle hold the road. The blue tooth is simple to hook to you phone.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Trey And Kyme's Camry   I normally don't like imports but I love me and my wife's car!!! It has great gas milage, the sport look of it just blooks like it screams through the air! I would recommend this car to anyone. At least go and test drive one."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Take It Back - Please   I have owned 6 Toyota's. This is the fourth Camry and if I could give it back I would. The car is great except for one major flaw. The outside air vent stays open. You have to hit the button every three minutes for the vent to close. I live in an urban area and travel an hour and or more each day to and from work. I feel like a chicken having to peck the button every 3 minutes to keep from being choked to death by exhaust! This is a deal breaker for me. I wish we had gone with the Altima. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"This Car Is Quiet And Comfy, Awesome Vehicle.   We love this car and the lease program is amazing. very high residual value and low down payment at signing. Simply awesome program. We have full factory warranty for 36 months, Insurance is cheaper than our Mazda we traded, and fuel mileage is 31+. The best car I have ever owned."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,My 2009 Camry Hybrid   I bought this Hybrid in March 2008. We considered the Prius but were used to the size and comfort of the Camry which the Prius does not have. Have been driving Camry for 20 years and always had good service. Disappointed with highway mileage (37-38)when our LE gets that much if you keep it under 75. This is just my opinion! I would recommed this car but sadly I don't think I will buy another one. This car is fully loaded with Leather and Navigation and Sunroof.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Camry Hybrid 2009   Very good car and cheap on gas. Excellent build quality. Good sound system. Surprisingly powerful for a 4 cylinder. Comfortable like a limousine. Very good price for what you get (full equipped with everything). Excellent XM Satellite Radio. Electric A/C, super cool when stuck in traffic and not wasting gas!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Nice Fun To Drive, Smooth And Responsive!   Performance - A 6 cylinder engine with a 4 cylinder gas millage consumption! You can feel the ponies! Fun Factor - It is so much fun to ride it and be on the phone at the same time!!! Using the integrated Blue tooth! Appearance - Interior styling similar to a Lexus...A lot of controls on the wheel."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Great Improvement Over The 2007!   A good loyal car, won't break down on you, and if you treat it well, it'll get you great gas mileage without the burden of having to buy a hybrid. Bought all 4 of the Camry's' my family owns at Miller Toyota in Manassas, VA. Great dealership, they won't screw around with you!"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"This Is My First New Car   I haven't got the car yet, just order from the dealer, it's $22166 with 6CD bluetooth package. I got a lot of positive feedback about this car. Confortable, reliable, etc.by the way, I like the super white color very muchI will write more after I get the car in mid August."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Buy A Camry   I love that it gets good gas mileage. And of course the six speaker stereo system is kickin'. And who doesn't love the smell of a new car. I bought the manual transmission package which gives the 2.4 even more get up and go. The interior is soft and the seating is comfortable. I have not noticed any road noise as the car rides pretty quiet. The only feature I wish it had was remote entry. I didn't think new cars came without it, but this one did. I recommend buying the Camry."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"I Love My 2009 Camry Hybrid!!!!!   I ordered a fully loaded 2009 Camry Hybrid. ALL the bells and whistles, including all the ""accessories"". This car is worth EVERY penny of the money I spent!. When I drove off of the lot, it had 2 miles on it. So far, I now have 1,300 miles and consistently get 35.4 mpg in the city (which includes daily expressway driving - and I am definitely no ""granny"" driver). The car is very quiet, handles well, feels very luxurious inside and gets awesome gas mileage. Now that I have become used to having smart key and bluetooth, it would be VERY difficult to go back to not having it....they are my favorite features of the car. I did ALOT of research (2 years!) on many different cars/SUV's comparing them and the Camry Hybrid came out with the best of everything. (My sister bought an LE Camry a week after I bought mine!) I drove a 1997 Camry for the past 10 years with NO problems at all, and have a good feeling that I will get 10 years out of this car. My son is 8 yrs old....I keep telling him this will be his car in 8 years....I have faith that it will still be running like new....:-)"
2009,Toyota ,Camry,One Of The Greatest Toyotas Out   This an all out wonderful car. My mother has this car and it is just plain perfect. No problems at all. Really nice interior and not that bad on the exterior.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Best Car We Have Ever Owned   Tom's new car, he traded in his 2006 Toyota 4 Runner for a bright red Toyota SE V6 Camry. He loves it and loves drinivng it. Fletcher Jones was able to get our payments right where we wanted them. This Cmary SE is extremely fun to drive and makes you feel like you are driving a race car."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,2009 Doesn't Compare With 98 Camry   What a lousy thing to do to the CAMRY. Our 98 4cyl was one of the best vehicles I ever owned.The 2009 is terrible. This 4cyl is underpowered for this car! No torque! Gas milage so far is worse then the 98. Engine makes more noise then the 98 did with 100k on it! Trans shifts up and down eraticly (downshift by itself going down hill?). It plows into turns like an old Buick. The armrests are not comfortable.
2009,Toyota ,Camry,Love The Car Hate The 4 Cyl.   4 cyl. is to small for this car...vehicle downshifts on the freeway going over overpass..flat area Houston Texas...have to acclerate hard for power..
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Impressed Buyer   I had previously owned 4 suvs, the most recent the 05 4 runner. I thought I would feel uncomfortable driving this Camry. Once I test drove this Camry, I was sold. I am 6' 4 and I was very comfortable driving this vehicle. The main reason I wanted the 09 camry was for better fuel economy but I couldnt help the smile on my face when I felt the smooth ride. So far, I am very happy with my purchase."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Sporty Looking, Not A Performer   It is more show than go - of course it is a 4 cylinder family sedan, an econo-box, and 2009 is/was the pinnacle of Toyota's not so secret slide away from good quality. It looks more like a ""tuner"" ride - I get a lot of teens and 20 somethings giving the car admiring looks, but I'm in my 50's and not looking for that kind of attention. It should make a really good kids car because it is roomy and somewhat comfortable with a full load of passengers. The 4 cylinder is decidedly under powered but acceleration is good after 50 up to 90 mph. The faux metal interior surfaces get dirty with the slightest touch and are difficult to clean - think stainless steel kitchen appliances, but worse. Stereo can barely get loud enough to exceed highway noise ( the car is noisy) and by then you are deafened by the decibels. The ride is stiff because it is a SE model which has the cross bar reinforcements in the frame behind the back seats, which is why it is the ONLY model of Toyota that the rear seats do not lay down for greater storage. Handling is still pretty nebuleous. At 43K I changed the factory installed ""performance tires"" and went with BF Goodrich AWR and they made it a greatly improved car in all aspects, mileage, noise, wet handling, snow handling etc. Best decision yet."
2009,Toyota ,Camry,"Sweet Camry !   One of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I get compliments on the color (Pearl Blue Metallic) all the time, and it catches me off guard as Camry's aren't known necessarily fo their looks, but certainly their reliability. This one has been bullet proof ! Very quiet on the road, quite comfortable on long trips, and I can actually get 34 MPG. Who would need a hybrid with this kind of fuel efficiency ?"

2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"If You Want A Good Suv I Highly Reccomend It, It's Extremely Reliable.  "
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,The Best Suv On The Market   It is a tough all purpose vehicle that can handle any occasion. The best thing about a 4Runner that beats the others in class is that the back seats lay down and the cargo area is flat enough to lay an air mattress and sleep in the vehicle for long trips.
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Love This Car...8 Out Of 10   Love the look of the car, nav, back up camera, leather seats and the drive of the car. I love the room provided in the back seat and the room for storage behind the second row for family traveling fun"
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Comfortable, Safe, Reliable And Durable Suv   The Toyota 4Runner is a comfortable, safe, reliable and durable SUV. Until 2009 it was available with either a 6 or 8 cylinder engine. In the current model (2010 to 2014) the 4.0 Liter 6 cylinder is the only power plant available."
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,4-runner Review   Great SUV - This SUV one of the best looking SUVs in the market today. Looks totally cool. Drives awesome. It's got large cargo space. Back Seats folds down. Superb Handling. Fair gas mileage. it has a good sound systems. Access to control is very convenient.
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"The Best Suv On The Road   Toyota builds a tougher, more reliable midsize SUV than anyone else. It handles great on all roads, including wet and snow packed. The Toyota traction control system is superior to other systems that are on the market. The only downside is that the driver can not disengage the traction control in 2 wheel drive in the event that he/she wants to spin in the snow. This can be a challenge because the 4 wheel drive may require some vehicle movement to engage. If the 4Runner gets stuck in snow or mud while in 2 wheel drive, the traction control system can prevent the driver from getting any movement because it will not allow the driver to spin tires to gain traction to move a few feet to engage the 4x4. The work around for this is to simply engage the 4 wheel drive before you need it."
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Love, Love, Love This 4runner!   I couldn't ask for a better vehicle. I have a job where I have to carry a lot of bulky equipment and this vehicle has been able to accomodate everything I have needed. I feel very safe in this SUV. It looks, handles and accelerates very nicely! Fun to drive! I have not had any maintenance done besides the recommended services. Toyota is the #1 brand of automobiles so no worries there!"
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Great Car For The Long Haul   I have used this car everyday as my office as an outside salesman. I love this car. It is great for towing, the snow, camping, just about anything. You can easily remove the back seats for car camping. I have no issues with this car after 120,000 miles."
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Best Quality And Handling In Class   Strong and reliable engine and a comfortable ride. I like the styling, quality and handling in snow. The interior is fully functional, controls are easy to use. I would recommend this SUV to anyone who wants a strong vehicle surrounding them..."
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"If You Want A Good Suv I Highly Reccomend It, It's Extremely Reliable.   Performance: all around great Build: Never had any issues Appearance: Great, hood scoop has a great look to it Fun Factor: Haha It's the only car I like driving anymore... it's the car I learned how to drive in, and it's completely and totally a wonderful car to own."
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,4runner   It is solid car with very good performance and have a lot of room inside. I like it and have no problem with it. The disadvantage is 17-21MPG.
2007,Toyota ,4Runner,"Hmmm...   stiff suspension, sensitive brakes, hood scoop not so great. overall ride, sound system, amenities great."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,Best Car I Have Ever Owned!   When I originally purchased this car I was already well aware of how great this experience would be. I have several friends that own this car and it depreciates the slowest of any SUV. It's a very comfortable family car with tons of options but can also be used for off-road.
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"A True Suv   This was the third 4Runner I've owned and 10th Toyota. They are great reliable vehicles. With a Toyota, it's not what you pay for the vehicle, it's the value. I had all the scheduled maintenance done on all the vehicles and haven't experienced any breakdowns with any systems. In the end of ownership it rewards me with having one of the lowest depreciation values in the industry."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"This Is A Great Combination Of A Luxury Vehicle With The Option To Go Off The Road.   Performance- I love how this car accelerates I never have problems keeping up. Appearance- I love the color Mica = green, grey, black all in one depending on the light. Fun factor- The sunroof and automatic back window roll down makes you feel like you are driving a convertible...."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"A Great Suv To Own   It is a nice and solid SUV. I have it for over 2 years and no any problem at all so far. The only concern is: it drinks too much gas - 20 miles per gallon for highway, 17 miles for city."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"Last Toyota I Will Own.   Several issues. Wore through factory floor mats, replaced under warranty. Almost through replacement. Several issues with built in TomTom. Finally fixed after 8 trips to dealer. Vent control LCD screen went dim, replaced under warranty. Supposedly I don't get in and out correctly, so driver bolster is ripping. Cheap leather. Will not look at, will not fix."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"Perfect   Great all around SUV. Built on a Truck frame with 4WD performance. No available Locking Rear Differential in 2008 leaves some room for upgrades later. Mileage around 20mpg in stock form, drops quickly with offroad tires. Kinda big, but not too bad."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,I Should've Had A V8   Good source of transportation. This vehicle is our third car so it stays in the garage most of the time. It was a dealer demo so it was a good price. I added leather seats to it which made it more my style.
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"4wheeldriver On A Budget   Simply a great car! Averaging 23mpg on highway, this is the perfect match for the 4wheel driver enthusiast on a budget that I am.this car surely is build to last and go anywhere you like from the rocky road of Jasper NP to the hot sand of the Death Valley."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"2008 4runner   Love it...awesome suv. 25 mpg gas mileage....fun to drive...low maintenance...exterior represents a beautiful vehicle...interior is comfortable yet appealing...performance is unbelievable...so far, this truck has not had any problems that I have had to repair. Cost of ownership=excellent. couldn't ask for a better vehicle!!!!"
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"My 4runner....   It's got everything I need. No fancy bells and whistles. Plenty of room for my kids and dog. The silver is rather common but I got that color for ease of maintenance. It has decent power and the gas mileage, although not fantastic, is tolerable. I always wanted a 4Runner and now I have one. My last car was a 2006 Black Lexus GS430. Stressed me out having that. It was hard to keep clean, everything beeped, chimed, bells went off, lights flashing...Geez, it was way too much...I'm so much more relaxed having this car. And it's very practical."
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,Best 4runner I've Owned Compared To My 95 4runner.  
2008,Toyota ,4Runner,"Best 4runner I've Owned Compared To My 95 4runner.   This SUV delivers all the goods for the $$$. Safety, fuel mileage, rock solid reliability, and excellent build quality was a seller. I've test driven many other models in the same class, but the 4runner was stil my final choice. Go Toyota!!!"
2009,Toyota ,4Runner,"""The steering feels stiffer and more responsive"""
2009,Toyota ,4Runner,"""In me wrangler the jeeps were just easier to clean compared to the cloth in the 4runner """
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Awsome   Along with a grate ride, acceleration and handling that will surprise! Road noise could be a little better. Roomy interior for both people and cargo. Strikes a good balance between ride comfort and sure-footed handling. Overall a very good SUV. It's a Toyota. I found the transmission very responsive depending on the mode you select. Its 6 cylinder will of course shift gears more often than say a 4 cylinder. But we also enjoy 26 mpg."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Nothing   The Toyota RAV 4 is an excellent car to move around with your family. I never had any mechanical problem and the maintenance is very easy and cheap. I highly recommend this car for families and also children going to school.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Excellent   I love this car. No problems. Handles great. I can sleep in this car when I go camping. My favorite part is the heated seats and the moon roof. I keep the roof open all year!! Acceleration is great too.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Good Little Utility Car   This is a fun little utility vehicle. Good gas mileage and has been reliable for the 3 years I have owned it. More style than a CR-V. Comfortable front seats. The accelerator can be a little sensitive and doors sound a little hollow when closed.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Decent Small Suv But Lots Of Recalls   Good gas mileage (4 cyl.). Decent power. Decent handling. Enough room for 2 adults 2 kids (baby seats). Trunk space is adequate. Cruise control is too choppy. Too small for 3 adults 2 kids, no 3rd row seats in ours. No aux in on stereo. Several recalls issued so far on this model. Tire pressure sensors failed. Overall it has been ok but the Highlander is a huge upgrade for us."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"King Of The Road   This is a very fun car to drive. The 4x4 ability makes you feel safe whether you are driving in snow, mud, rough roads or even if you just want to punch it and pass a few cars. Great for young drivers that are starting out and/or for a small family."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Reliable And Get The Job Done!   Overall it is a great vehicle for about anything. It will get you through the daily commute. It hauls and carries just about anything you would need it to; groceries, kids, furniture, large boxes, snow boards, small trailers, etc. It is GREAT on icy roads during winter. Overall I would probably buy it again if I had a bunch of kids or did a lot of outdoor sports and needed ""that"" type of car."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Why Toyota Rav4 Rocks   I have owned this car for 4 years never had any problems. The acceleration is very good.The trunk has alot of space for unimaginable stuffs.The gas mileage is very great and overall performance brilliant. Another thing is the car has a great resale value
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Toyota Rav 4 2.2 D4d Black Pack   it's a pretty good 4-wheel drive car. it's not that fast because it's pretty heavy, but that' s normal for a 4x4. It's a toyota so the quality can't be better.its got a very high fun factor. it doesnt consume a lot"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"I Love It And Would Like To Get Another Rav4 With Awd   * Performance - great acceleration, smooth steering, smooth downshifts and subtle engine sound. * Build Quality - good brand quality. period * Appearance - 1 of the top 3 reasons I chose the Rav4 * Cost of Ownership - excellent gas mileage for its size, repairs might be coslty after 8 years * Fun Factor - I drive it everyday, love it"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Rav 4 2007   good acceleration great gas mileage,bad brakes,bad engine sound,good interior quality with leather,decent sound system instaled originally, no squeaks nor rattles no repairs yet! more than 40000 miles on bad roads driven with it and must say this is a fun car to drive comfortable in city easy to repair but you can drive it off road too with no problem! 4/5"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Get One   Awesome -- I'm going to get another one just like it when my lease ends. It's a nice combination of performance (high horsepower, smooth, responsive), SUV size (sits up high, but not too big), and style (love the red color, Barcelona Red Metallic)."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,My Most Impressive Vehicle In 50 Years Of Motoring   This rugged looking vehicle is more refined than it looks with good performance and comfort. Toyota have shown that they really know how to screw things together to make a robust and reliable car. That's why depreciation is so low. The Rav4 may be a 4x4 but it performs and corners like a sporting saloon. All round it's an economical fun car to drive and own.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,4cyl 2007 Rav 4   Mirror controls are from a car where they're mounted differently and are mirror image to what they should be. Invariably move the mirror the wrong way. It goes pretty well off-road. The ESP is good in tight slippery stuff. The seats are a bit hard on a long trip. Very reliable so far. Needs more power. Get the 6 cylinder version.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Love My Toyota   This is my Second Toyota - the first one Saved my life in an accident so I am a Toyota Owner for life. The Rav4 is Roomy - with tons of head and leg room for passengers in front and back seats, and the folding rear seats mean I can get all my gear in when I head out to do Jewelry shows or go Camping. It has plenty of power to keep me moving and the all wheel drive is great in the snow. I get an average of 25 MPG - even with the stop and go traffic in town - and maintenance has been a breeze. It's a Safe, Reliable car that's fun to drive and comfortable for the long haul. I LOVE my RAV4"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Great Car!   It's a awesome suv in it's class but the awd uses way to much gas...(i could get better gas mileage on a jeep on awd) black is great and the 6 disc changer is great but i wish it had heated seats in the back of the car... btw don't get the seven seater it's a pain no room... but overall great power and i like the V6 engine...
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Sporty Ravvy   The new redesign of the RAV4 for 2007 is impressive. It looks much more appealing than earlier versions. Outside the grill is nice and shiny, the wheels are decent looking, and the rear spoiler is appealing. The limited model sports a peppy V6 engine. It shifts superbly and accelerates very quickly. The interior is roomy to accommodate 5 passengers very comfortably. The stereo system sounds very good. It also includes an in dash 6-Disc CD changer with MP3 and WMA capability. Inside the glove box is an aux jack to plug in your iPod or other portable MP3 player. This saves from poor radio transmitted quality. This is a great car but with a bit overpriced tag."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Good Road/offroad Compromise   This car has decent power (269 HP and 246 lbft) and handling. On road driving is great, offroad compromised some by tires but still capable. I would still like to increase power, the car can handle more. The ESP can be great and also annoying when driving hard. I'm very napping with this car."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Love It   We drove so many ""small"" SUV's. There was something we liked about all of them, but the RAV4 had the best combination of amenities for the price. We love the pick up of the V6 although we aren't so thrilled with the V6 gas mileage. The car is attractive and comfortable. We've taken it on a 2000 mile road trip. The cargo space is wonderful. I'd prefer a clamshell hatch type cargo door, but maybe in the next generation?"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"I Love My Lil Rav4.....   It drives like a sporty car, has a revvy but fuel efficient 2.4L 4cyl that has reasonable amount of torque, lots of room, classy interior lots of neat safety and comfort features, cheap to own and operate, and good looking( I got mine in silver metallic) , with alloy wheels, bluethooth connetion through the spekers,"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Rav 4   I like it cause it's fast, gets good mileage, is relatively compact and has a lot of interior room. Not as quiet as a Lexus, though."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Love My Rav   I love the speed, the fuel efficiency. I don't like the cheap leather and the rattling from the sun roof when it's popped up in the back."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Suprisingly Big   Great size, comfortable seating position. Gauges are clear and easy to read. Very versatile storage. Has a storage bay under floor on trunk. 2nd row seats fold flat to floor, and has tilt, forward and back adjustments. actually 1 or 2 MPG less than Camry sedan. Transmission though smooth, isn't as impressive as V-6, which is 5-speed auto and 1 mpg worse gas mileage."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Really Confortable And Sturdy To Drive. I Love My Car :-)   Good car, Toyrota is a very reliable manufacturer, so guaranteed a car for years to come, unless i dont crash it."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"It's An Suv... With A 270 Bhp V6!   It looks like a boring SUV, but once you put your foot down it can surpirse you with the amount of power on tap.."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"One Of The Best Suvs Ever!   This car is more refined than any other RAV4, and it handles well. It's even quiet and comfortable, an easy rider. It makes a good towcar as well!"
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,Great Vehicle   Love that they have gotten bigger inside over the years. Handles well.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"Perfect Vehicle, I Love It   The Rav4 is everything I want in a vehicle. It drives like a sporty car, has a revvy but fuel efficient 2.4L 4cyl that has reasonable amount of torque, lots of room, classy interior( My came with wood grain which makes it look and feel luxurious)lots of neat safety and comfort features, cheap to own and operate, and good looking( I got mine in nautical blue) I wish I would have got the alloy wheels instead of hubcaps though."
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,The Rav 4 Is A Comfortable Vehicle With Versatility   The RAV 4 is agile in sharp turns and narrow spaces. It has nice comfort and leg room. Roomy cargo area. Good accelleration for a 4 cyl.
2007,Toyota ,Rav4,"My Favorite Suv Ever!   We leased a new 2007 RAV4 (Limited) a couple of months ago, and we absolutely love it. The Barcelona Red color looks awesome. We got the bigger engine (269 horsepower V6), and you can really feel the difference when you step on the accelerator. The ride is quiet, comfortable, and smooth. There's plenty of space up front, for the passengers, and in the back for groceries etc. We got the four-wheel drive model, and it's been useful in our snowboarding trips up north. Handling is sure and responsive. I can't recommend this car highly enough."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"My Rav4's A Keeper   Love my RAV4. I like not having to worry about using too much gas when I run around town. It gets fairly good gas mileage. Maintenance has be very low cost. The brakes could be better on the 2008. I wish I had gotten the heated seats with the leather, Well rounded car for around town, back and forth to work. The 4 Cyl. has plenty of power for my needs."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,Love My Rav4   I did a lot of research up front before buying my first RAV4 with the new body style (which changed in 2006) I liked my 06 so much I traded it in for this 08. I work in the computer service industry and this vehicle has all of the features I needed with lots of cargo space and the 269 HP V6 with the 5 speed transmission (the same engine and power train found in the Toyota Avalon)it's great for crisp performance while still giving 23 MPG in the city.
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"I Love My Rav4!!!   This Rav4 is the best! Not only has a good gas mileage, and easy to maintenance. And it doesn't cost me an arm and a legs to take care of it. And it has a very good space (roomy) inside. Overall, its a good car and fun to drive."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,Fantastic!   My first brand new car - the start of many! Great handling even with a chick driver. Spacious with loads of extra storage space under floor and movable seats. Personalised plates add a personal touch. First of new model and I LOVE IT!
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Oh What A Feeling   cant complain its not the hilux or land cruiser that i want, but you have to start some where, can always up grade down the track, it does the job, it gats me from a to b and camping too"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Perfect   i love my car, is perfect for my family because we get out a lot and i need space for my two sons, my husband and me. my car is fun to drive i just love it too much you need to try it."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"The Best Choice   Japanese quality(unbreakable!), low fuel consummation(over 7.2 L/100km) good high speed - 215km/h, 0-100km/h in 10 sek. Very good off-road abilities... The interior is luxurious, the exterior is stylish!!! The handling is perfect, there is 9 airbags as serial... with 2 words - PERFECT S U V!!!! enjoy it:)"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"<3   Performance: -Acceleration: It's so worth having a V6 it's ridiculous. On a RAV4, you feel like it's a little rocketship of power! -Braking: Brakes really well. -Handling: Turns great! Build Quality: -No repairs needed yet... -NOIIIIIIIIISYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY...mostly road noise :( You have to turn the stereo upppppppp... Appearance: -interior: I think it could be a little nicer. It's just plastic on top of the bare metal...no soundproofing at all (it's what contributes to the rattles while driving). -exterior: Only complaint is that the rear bumper seems really weak...I'm afraid to rest my knee on it. :\ Cost: -gas mileage: much nicer than the previous car I used to drive -maintenance: Ummm...it's fine? Fun Factor: I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS CAR. I might be biased because it is MY first official car. :3"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Rav4 Great In Town Or On The Road.   Our RAV4 v6 is a dream to drive on the highways. We have had the RAV4 for 6 months and have had it on three 1500 mile trips through desert, mountains and seashores. Good handleing both heavy or light loads and brakes good enough for the freeways. We have made 24-25 miles per gallon mileage for the last three month. Great car for city or road."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"A Toyota Rav 4.....amazing??   I will say for a first car, this is not a mad one to get. The car is great quality and even inexpensive for the people who want to go for basic. (under 20,000) I chose to go with the leather and 4wd. I will say that i love the combination and good looks for a small SUV. it also has the V4 which one might think is pathetic, but has more to it then one would think."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"I Love My Little Rav4   This is the perfect car for me-- it's small enough that it gets good gas mileage but also totally functional. I can throw down the seats and haul my bike, kayak (on top of course) and camping stuff without having to rent a u-haul trailer. I also love the secret comparments-- totally cool. Oh and I'm lovin the automatic and the sun roof too! If this were a hybrid it would be perfect!!!!"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Best Small Suv   Best Small Suv In its class, love the way in handles everything about it great. I wish it had a little bit better gas mileage but thats about the only thing I would change. It is fun to drive I love driving and listening to music in my Toyota. Awesome!"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Midnight   I love it, has a lot of room, gets god gas mileage which is something we all need in todays society. It is black on black with the black tinted windows so it is looking pretty hot! I love to drive it and sometimes I still feel like I am in my scion. It has good pickup and great speed, just watch out for the popo!"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"My Mommy Car   It handles like a dream, is so comfortable to drive, the back seats recline and can be adjusted like the front seats so it's super comfy. and there are so many neat features."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"My Personal Experience Owning A Rav4   Just recently own a Rav4, overall I think it's very good vehicle for a small size SUV. Hidden compartment is well build in"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Great Value For Money   Performance is not so great, due to the 4 cylinder engine. V6 option would be different. The interior is much better compared to some of the other Toyota models. Lots of space inside, and customizable seating and trunk arrangement. Comes with a mp3 compatible stereo with adequate power. Not a serious off-roader but good enough to get over the necessary foot paths."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Squirrly   If this car was available with a 5 speed, it damn near be the ultimate sleeper. 268hp V6 in a relatively light package. I have yet to drive one that is FWD, but I am pretty sure FWD is only available on the 4 cylinder models, but I imagine it would be very burnout-happy if available! Thank God for traction control!"
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"If You Love Fiction Than You Would Love Toyota's Rav4 19/26 Mpg Estimates   I purchased a 2008 Toyota RAV4 V6 4x4 on October 2007. So far I drove the car 4500 miles. The MPG I get in the real world is nowhere near the published EPA MPG rating of 19 City and 26 Highway. Under ideal highway driving conditions, i.e., flat road, no passengers or cargo, driving at constant speed of 65mph, the most I can squeeze out of the RAV4 is 20MPG, a significant difference don't you think so? And if you contact Toyota with a question on the lower than estimated MPG they stonewall you."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"Would Definitely Buy This Again - For My Wife.   I got the Ultra-Loaded Rav4, complete with keyless entry, push-button ignition, leather interior, heated front seats, sunroof, you name it. Surprising array of features on an entry-level small SUV. Power is to be expected from a 2.0l, 4cyl engine, but I would definitely rank it above the others in its class. I'm no off- roader, but I got stuck in some mud once and needed a 350 pound guy to ""push"" my car out of the mud - despite having engaged the push-button 4WD. If only the 3.5l V6 variant was available in the Caribbean."
2008,Toyota ,Rav4,"2008 Rav4 V6   The V6 version of the Rav4 is a rocket! 270hp that handles very well for an SUV. Fit and finish is excellent - no rattles, no wind noise. The JBL stereo is superb for a factory set up. I love the pearl white paint as well, however small rust spots are showing up in top coat. Showed it to my Toyota dealer and they used Clay bar that took them right out."

2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"Rav4 Review (limited, V6, 4wd)  "
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"I Love It, It Is A Perfect Average Family Suv   I loved the gas mileage. I loved the shape and rims on the vehicle. I loved the price for parts. I loved how dependable the vehicle is. even after 103,000 miles I have never experienced any mechanical issues and don't expect to for a long time."
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,Awesome Ride   The V6 has great acceleration and fine handling. Everything is simply great about this car especially value for money... if it wasn't for the plastic parts in the interior it would have passed as a Lexus No navigation packages were offered in Canada for this model. The upgraded audio system from JBL and the back view mirror were valuable additions
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"Great To Drive, Plenty Of Room, Low Road Noise, Great Audio, But The Rattle In The Back Is Annoying.   * The performance is overall great, no sluggish response, and for a small SUV the turns are very smooth. *Build Quality: The build outside seems great, however, inside the car I can hear a small plastic rattling in the back. Side note: there is plenty of room on the inside, I am 6'5 and I don't feel cramped at all. *Cost of ownership: isn't bad so far. I get approx 22 MPG in the city and burbs, and the price for gas isn't terrible *Fun Fact: The steering feel very responsive, the turns are smooth and it's really fun to drive, and the blind spots aren't bad at all for a SUV."
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"Best Small Suv, That's It   This is a great small SUV. There is no other vehicle in it's category that has the power this V6 has. Few people know but it has 269HP and is the same motor that's in the lexus IS and RX, Toyota Avalon. Toyota's buttery smooth 3.5 V6 that still gets 27 on the highway. The sport has stiffer suspension and great looking 18""s with 55 profile tires and an identical spare."
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,Rav4 Is A Terrific Car.   The RAV4 handles incredibly well. The engine is extremely quick for a 4-cylinder. The ride is very smooth and turning is a dream. I like the overall interior and how the Ipod adapter is set up so you can change settings as you drive.
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,Awesome Car   what's not to like in the RAV.... near perfect.... I wish it came with in dash navigation but I was told it's only available in US models. The thing I love the most is the roaring of the very responsive engine when you press down the gas pedal
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"More Than I Expected From A Small Suv   09 rav sport, love the V6, really quick and fun to drive, handles great.Exterior looks great, interior could be a little more advanced but not terrible, I`m 6'2"" and its a comfortable ride. First foreign manufactured car ever. So far I am impressed. Traded a Dodge dakota for the Rav. Love the Rav, Dakota was ok. Rav has great gas milage and build feels solid with good braking and excelleration. Not sure about having runflats, and radio volume could be better. Overall very happy with Toyota."
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"Rav4 Review (limited, V6, 4wd)   The fastest car I've ever owned. Quicker than a Mazda Miata. 0-60 in 6.1 seconds and quarter mile in 14.6 seconds! Great gas mileage to boot! Build quality is great. It's a Toyota. Appearance is sleek. Leather inside, moonroof, JBL audio + subwoofer. Cost is low. I only expect routine maintenance. It is very fun!"
2009,Toyota ,Rav4,"Great Car For The Money And As An Entry Level Suv.   The acceleration of this car with a V6 is great. The transmission shifts smoothly and ride is a bit stiffer than the two wheel drive version. The car handles very well and brakes are excellent. The car is an excellent commuter vehicle with the handling, ride, and fuel economy. Being a Toyota, the car requires little maintenance except for normal servicing."

2007,Toyota ,Prius,"I May Just Buy The Bigger Model Since I Was So Happy With This One And I Would Also Buy The Red One.   I have owned Chevy, Ford, VW, MG, etc, and am very impressed with the Prius it is everything they promised. This car has been tested to the max by me in the snow. Since I have a very long driveway with an uphill grade snow does not make me nervous. It's a great car."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,Awesome Car All Around Best Toyota Ever Made   Great car overall requires very little maintenance and the gas mileage. Car requires oil changes just like any other car. You don't have to plug it in the battery charges when you go down hill or just sitting at a light. The technology and research that went into this car to get it right is just astounding!!!
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"I Am Considering Another Prius.   Over 219,000 miles I have replace the front brake pads and one battery (the main battery). It was out of warranty by 40,000 miles but Toyota paid for half of the battery cost and half of the labor to install it. Other than these items the car has been the best car I have ever owned."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Happy.   When you really, really like your car, it's hard to be non-biased about it. The only reason I am selling my 2007 Prius is so that I can use the proceeds as a down payment on a 2014 Prius, while the resale value is high."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Love My Work Horse Of A Car!   I really enjoy the economy, reliability, and it has a great sound system for my long journeys. I have done very little in maintenance and what needed fixed was very reasonable. It is also fairly comfortable for a hybred. Lots more room than you'd expect."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Very Dependable And Fun Car To Drive And The 41.4 Overall Average Miles Per Gallon Can't Be Beat.   I really like the engine break gear when traveling over the Sierra's. When I put on the cruise control, the Prius maintains its speed even on the steepest of hills. Its aerodynamic design handles the high winds extremely well. The constant consumption and energy guidance system trained me to not jack rabbit start and stop, improving miles per gallon and making the brakes last longer."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"A Low-testosterone Car That's High On Fuel Economy.   It saves me money, but it's beating me to death on my 90-mile round-trip commute to work. The hatchback is great; The way the opening is shaped, I can load a lot of whatever by folding down the back seats."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Prius Is Great, Very Hi-tech, Well Designed.   I started with a Gen1, 2002 Prius with almost 300,000 miles but ran great with only the need of replacement of the OEM12 volt battery. However, the one time I had a system warning light Iite (Tiangle of Death). I took it to the dealer and they told me to they would have to replace the HV Traction battery, for almost $3500 (more than i paid for the car). Took it home and went on line, read the manuals and did my own testing. Traced problem to the 12 volt battery having low voltage and corroded connections. Used jumper battery to prove that this was the problem and it was. Replaced the 12 volt with Optima Yellow Top and never hand another problem. Have since sold that car to a friend and she loves it (once she got beyond the concern about the high mileage) and ""just enjoy"" the fine ride. I now have a 2007 Gen2 Prius that I am in the process of converting to Plug-in-Hybrid/EV. Steve"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Every One Should Own A Prius   Great handling and very safe vehicle. It drives well in all kinds of weather. Never done towing but handles well on mountain roads. I recommend as a first car as it's easy to drive and the rear camera makes for easy, bumpless parking."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Guilt Free Car Trips   Back in 2007 we saw Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" we went out and bought a Prius. I've never regretted it, should have bought two. It's hard to describe to younger generations what it's like to drive guilt-free, but driving the prius in todays world comes close that feeling I had in high school back in 1968 when I got my license and gas was $0.34/gal. Driving was a blast. The Prius isn't quite as exhilarating as my motorcycle, but I can go really long distances much more comfortably."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Very Nice Toyota Prius With Leather Seats And Gets 40-50+ Mpg!   This is the best and favorite car I have ever owned. It is great for in town and highway driving. I have put over 20k miles on this car in about half a year, and I would sell it to someone I know and recommend a Prius to anyone."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Buy It If You Absolutely Must Have The Best Fuel Economy, Or Want To Present An Eco-frienldy Image.   I started my DriverÍs Education class in the summer of 2008, and after a couple hours of class work, my instructor put me at the wheel of a brand new Prius. This example was designed specifically for driving instruction, since it had a second brake pedal for the passenger and ñStudent Driverî decals along the sides. My initial snail-pace cruise around the parking lot was, at that moment, the most fun I had ever had in my life. I relished the feeling of being in total control (save for the occasional stomp on the passenger-brake by my instructor when we got too close to a curb). The experience of driving a modern hybrid was a bit disconcerting for me as a novice driver. Most of the traditionally mechanical controls were electronic in the Prius. The parking brake, gear selector, and starter were all buttons on the dashboard. Speed was indicated by a digital display, and the tachometer was absent entirely. Acceleration was silent (until the gas engine started), and the brake pedal provided no feedback. Driving the Prius felt more like operating a computer than controlling a vehicle. The Prius had a back-up camera to make up for its poor rearward visibility, but since this was a luxury most cars didnÍt have, the instructor kept a towel draped over the screen, requiring me to turn around and look out the split rear window to reverse. It was only after driving my MomÍs Corolla that I finally got accustomed to what it felt like to drive a ""real"" car. This car was not one that I would ever choose to drive of my own free will, but it provided a door into a world that I would soon fall in love with, and so I have developed a respect for it (with mild reservations)."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,Great Car   best i know of and been making them sence 2002 prover to be great car nothing Car has tile cruse great on the highway and it town fill up about every 2 weeks in town saves gas gas gas gas gas
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Technologically Superior Vehicle.   Until you drive a car like this, you don't appreciate it. Say good-bye to the gas station, 44 MPG, typically fill it up with 8 gallons and you are off for another 350 miles, 5,000 miles between service, brake pads last forever. Silent and clean in parking lots, stop lights and drive thru's. Very safe car, easy to drive, quick, agile, and yet surprisingly roomy. Speed or power is not an issue. The cargo room will shock you."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,2007 Prius   This is a great economy car that can transport people and cargo for as cheap as possible. Minor imperfections but overall a fantastic car. I Would buy another and have heard that the newer ones get better gas mileage and some have lumbar support which is a major plus.
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"A Great Car For The Practical Minded!   the prius is an excellent car for people who drive a lot but don't mind the trade off of handling. after all, the prius was designed to be a practical car, not a high performance car! if you're looking for amazing fuel economy and a low cost vehicle to maintain, and you're ok with the odd looking shape and a bare bones driving experience, i recommend the prius."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,A Golf Cart You Can Drive On The Highway   Overall a Prius is great value. It's fun to drive with the fuel economy screen on and challenge yourself to max out the efficiency. What you'll find is that accelerating slow and driving carefully gets the best fuel economy. Who knew?
2007,Toyota ,Prius,Fantastic Car   Excellent car with great mileage and fantastic looks. The single owner factor is critical as the family has handled the vehicle with great care. The power is excellent does not present any challenge for fast ramp ups. The surprise element is the hatchback gives it a huge amount of space making it a true utility vehicle as well.
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Eco Practical   Very reliable and economical car. Very practical. It has low maintenance costs. It does not have a lot of acceleration and is somewhat noisy and has a slightly tinny feel, but this is the trade off you make for great gas mileage of 50 mpg."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Car Of The Future. Nothing Comes Close.   I still like the looks of the old muscle cars with sleek lines and powerful engine. This is the opposite. More like a beetle. But it is very practical, and efficient, and as high tech as a rolling computer. Well designed and well built and trouble free. Just not the prettiest or most powerful car I've driven. Technologically inspiring and exciting."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Well, My Wife Likes It. So Do I.   Really easy to drive, no clutch which is standard here in EU. Quiet. Great JBL audio. Driving position not so great. Good brakes. So far had no problems or unplanned maintenance. Prius is not so fun to drive as it is easy to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Loving My Little Toyota Prius   I had a lot of buyer's remorse at first because I spent more than I wanted to, but I love my car and I really love my gas mileage! People are always inquiring about it and they all love looking at the tiny little engine and everyone notices that you can't hear it running. It warms up fast in cold weather too!"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,Great Commuter Car In Town   great commuter car and the best mileage out there anywhere. Car actually rides very well and does 85 mph on highway and still gets 48 miles per gallon. just too small for the entire family and friends or any out of town guests
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Great   Great car, saves the planet too. Road tax is 15 quid a year. Looks great and is so quiet you sometimes don't know it is on. Best Toyota yet. Great fun as well. Definitely recommend it to a friend. Great car."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"I Love It And The New Version Will Have To Be Very Special To Beat It   Quiet, comfortable, full of gadgets (reverse camera, bluetooth, satnav.....) economic and quick enough. Very lazy and relaxed drive but sometimes a bit buzzy when pushed. EV mode is cool in car parks and travelling at 40mph or more using no fuel is great."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Love My Prius   We have had this Toyota Prius for two years and still love it. It gets 53 mpg in the summer and 45 mpg in the winter overall. The fit and finish is impeccable. We've had not one single thing wrong with the vehicle since we've owned it and would highly recommend it. It's quiet, very zippy, good handling. No rattles. It's fun to drive and I don't feel guilty driving around!"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"2007 Toyota Prius 4 Dr Review   Gas mileage is unbelievable but rear visibility isn't that great. It handles nicely but lacks power, and the brakes are a little touchy. And while the exterior styling isn't perfect, the interior makes up for it. Not a bad car if yoiu are looking for a hybrid."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"My Prius   I am laughing all the way to the pump. 50 mpg, gotta love it!! Car runs great, takes a little to get use too. Considering how small it is, the car is very roomy. For only having a 4 cylinder engine, the car has a lot of get up and go when you step on the gas."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"My Car !   For those who never tried it before, just step in to a Prius and you'll know right away ... For those who're afarid of the design, the other benefits are compansating it more then well. The Prius is very easy and comfortable to drive, I know already what my next car will be ... Yes another Prius !"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Toyota Prius Rocks!   This is the most awesome car on the road today. It's got a unique style, makes a statement about me, and saves me loads of money with gas near 4.00 a gallon. I love my Prius. She's beautiful and is a pleasure to drive. First of all, it's quiet - you can only hear her at select times. It hasn't needed any repairs at all, just keep up with the maintenance on it (oil changes, battery checks). Interiors are extremely nice, they've got that Toyota quality right in there, and the exterior is gorgeous. It takes a while to get used to, but you love them once you do. I get around 48mpg everywhere, and if I alter my driving style I can get better. It's hard to maximize the mileage because of all the other assholes on the road. It is so fun to drive! There are lots of bells and whistles and you can go for a Sunday drive and not feel guilty because you are using less gas than most people."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"The Most Wanted Car In America!   The Toyota Prius it made only in a hybrid model, and is one fo the best cars for the environment not to mention one of the cars that get the best gas milage. My car is the best selling hybrid in America, and are also the most wanted car in America as of right now! You may have problems trying to buy one at the dealership because there is like a three to four month wait on the Prius!"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"2007 Prius   Gas mileage on in town driving is less than I expected and less than my son gets on his 2005 Prius. Long distance mileage has been better than I was led to believe it would be so I guess it averages out. I'm really in love with this car! It has great style, comfortable ride and is roomy enough to haul a lot of ""stuff""."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Prius Panache   We are so happy with the car--it gets about 42 miles per gallon and is very comfortable. The seats fold down and we can carry quite a few things. It also runs on regular. The car is fun to drive, but it is wonderful not to be getting 15 or 18 m.p.g!"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"50 Miles Per Gallon, Low Stress, Fine Style   Drive one, you'll never go back. In NorCal they are *everywhere*. Our touring model has leather seats, rear camera, keyless entry - everything that opens and shuts."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Cool Car - A Bit Small For My 6' 2"" 250 Lbs. Body.   Other than I miss the roominess of my old Dodge van, I enjoy the Prius. But, when in Europe, I rent small cars, and many have lots of leg and head room. I wish Toyota could do that, too..."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"A Disapointment And A Step Back For Hybrids   I did not enjoy driving this at all, its ugly as hell, unresponsive, and awkward. The shifter is annoying, a little flickable mini joystick coming out of the dash area at a weird angle, when you flick it into drive or park or anything you have to check the dashboard to see if it actually did anything because it doesn't click or anything. I love the idea of hybrid cars but if this is the car to lead the hybrid revolution it will turn lots of people off, my advice would be to try a different hybrid like the Toyota Camry hybrid which looks great."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Intelligent   slower accelaeration than most cars, but i would recommend to friends because it is a very practical car. touch screen audio, climate, settings, and navigation system. great audio system if you get JBL audio option (i dropped in 2 10"" subs powered by a 400W amp to increase the bass)"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"Great, But Mpg Is Not As Good As Previous Four Toyota Prius'es That We Have Owned.   My wife and I are now into our fourth and fifth Toyota Prius'es (sp?). They have religiously given us about 44.4mpg until the fifth one which is a 2007 ""Touring"" model. Not sure what's happening, but I can't get above 40mpg. Drive it the same as the others; pretty hard, pretty fast. More city than highway driving. I have asked Toyota dealers, 1-800- TOYOTA and others what my problem with mpg might be, but no help. We love our Prius'es for reasons other than the mpg; mainly their high tech sides."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"2007 Touring Edition Is Worth It!   I just purchased a fully loaded 2007 Prius Touring model and I cannot say enough good things about it. I started taking Prius test drives in 2004, but the one I took last week (Jan 28, 2007) made me want to buy it immediately. The ride is smooth, the acceleration and noise levels reduced, the stylish rear bumper and larger interior space makes the Prius arrive as a REAL CAR! Other drivers on the road including Prius drivers will be gawking at you as you drive it down the road. I love the navigation system and the fact that all of my passengers are protected by front and rear curtain air bags. I have heard that the 2008 model will change significantly but feel that the 2007 Touring model of this fine Prius genre will remain a cult car. -Ken Graham Napa, CA"
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"A Great Choice For Gas Price Or Environmentally Concious   The car is simply wonderful and will appeal to any technophile, environmentalist or economical person. I am very happy with all the high-tech features this car has standards, that others only get in a luxury car (bluetooth phone integration, lcd dashboard screen, rear back-up cam, auto-dimming rear-view mirrors, keyless RF entry and ignition, etc.) Some people complain that the gas milage is no different, but you have to learn how to drive the car to get the full benefits of the electric motor. I easily average between 45 and 55 mpg (depending how much city/highway I do). If you are futilely zipping from red light to red light as fast as you can - the gas mileage will not be any better than any other vehicle."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"2007 Used Prius Base   The Silver is the cleanest looking. Best gas mileage, bar none. No mechanical problems during scheduled maintenance. Acceleration is good and braking is great. Fun to drive. Comfortable for 4 passengers. Audio system is really nice. Heat and air conditioning response time is great."
2007,Toyota ,Prius,"It Was The Future At The Time   49mpg and nicely equipped with nav, phone and mp3 player integration. Driver space a bit tight and awkward. OK performance and acceleration. High quality feel. Good trunk space and variability. Does everything to make you think mpg rather than speed."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great Economical Commuter Car   When I first got my Prius I was coming off of a Saab. The first thing I noticed is the car is light so if you are driving in a heavy cross wind you feel it a bit more. The acceleration speed is very good given its a hybrid. I have no issues getting onto highways. The ride is not as comfortable as other sedan (like my Saab was, I loved that car) but given its incredibly great gas consumption it more than makes up for it. Its a great commuter car or car for the new driver - very easy to drive."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Fine Commuting Commuting Car   Overall great car for daily commuting. I drove 132 mile every work day for 6.5 years and never a mechanical issue. Tires lasted over 75K miles, Brakes still good at 175000 miles (I use the ""B"" engine break to ""down shift"" in the city and hiway). Fairly comfortable (I've drive 10 hour days in the car and at 60+ I'm ok sitting that long). Great cargo area (with no passengers in the rear you can haul a 60"" screen TV NO PROBLEM). Over all a fairly ""utilitarian"" vehicle."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Save Tons Of Money On Fuel!   Since it has such great fuel economy, I found myself only having to fill this car up once every week and a half, considering I drive from and to work about a 25 - 30 mile distance! Very happy with this vehicle and I know you will be to!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,Great For Saving Money   like saving money. very peppy at slower speeds. great for getting around town. has a very good amount of space for good seating front and back. luggage area is great for one set of clubs setting width wise. looking for newer one.
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned   Great MPG and reliability. Fun to drive. This vehicle impresses most everyone who rides with us. Round trip from Michigan to Tampa, Florida for $210.00. Drive one and you'll buy one. My brothers 2002 Prius has over 200K on it and he's done virtually no repair maintenance to it, just recommended upkeep maintenance."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Loved This Car   I've never disliked this car, it's been a great car! It's got great power too, it's not a little put put car it can haul but, I've gotten a ticket in it and the cop asked me how fast I thought I was going and I said 78 and he clocked me doing 92. I was on a road trip and was listen to my radio and just lost track of my speed, so all the jokes about how it has no power is not true."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great Commuter Car!   The Prius Touring is a very nice vehicle. Ours has the leather interior, back-up camera and other features that make it a bit more upscale than a base Prius. Went from a 10 mile commute to a 60 mile commute for a new job and this Prius is just what we needed. Averaging 45+ combined MPG. While no one will mistake it for a roadster, the acceleration is fine and the car is extremely safe."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,Miles Per Gallon Baby!!!   More power then I would have expected for a car that get 40 to 50 miles per gallon. Lots of room in the back. Air is so cold you have to turn up the temp for its coldest setting. Overall I have been pleased driving this vehicle.
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Extra Low Mileage   Love driving, favorite car to drive in over 50 years of driving ! Extremely low mileage 22,777 ! Backup camera (safety . . . . . especially in my neighborhood, lots of little kids !) Smart key system, means you'll never hunting thrugh your pockets/purse for your keys, simply touch the door handle and then push the start button (you don't even have to insert the key !) Average miles per gallon equals 47 !"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Amazing Car!   The car was in very good condition, except that the tires were worn, but still passed inspection. The reason it was such a low price was that the mileage was 75,029. I love the car so much I am trying to buy another one!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Hybrid Prius!   One of the best car i ever own! Excellent gas mileage, one tank can go almost 1000km, Super quiet on EV mode, very good handling and spacious interior. One regret is i should have buy this car much more earlier!!!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Toyota Prius   Pretty cool. Green-tech FTW. I like the rear hatch, and the fact that the dash board has a little T.V. Screen on it to tell me my MPG. I have driven an older one and they seemed too futuristic. This one is just right."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great Car, Worth The Money. Was Considering A Corolla Or Camry, Glad I Chose Prius.   Love this car. Great mileage (duh!). Dirt doesn't show. I've put everything from lumber to skis to a toilet in it. Hauls almost as much as my Suburban! If only it seated 6. Maintenance has been suprisingly cheap. Best surprise was 30k mile service for less that $200! Also preferred parking at work and Best Buy. Can't beat that!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great For Someone Who Does Not Care What The Look Of Their Car Is.   this looks horrible and it impossible to see out of the back the car handles extremely well and feels comfortable while driving. the car costs around 30,000 when all is said and done if you get all the major upgrades (nothing performancewise.)"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,No Frills - It Works Well.   Good car - got 50 mpg last week. Acceleration and handling adequate. Interior comfortable. Low clearance means I drag the front end pulling out of parking lots frequently
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"You Are Not Doing Yourself Any Favors By Not Checking Out A Prius   LIKE mpg's (of course), the technology/gadgets; bluetooth, Voice/screen/steering wheel controls of nav/radio/CD/climate/phone and more, smart key (best invention ever) and spaciousness (probably one of the most spacious MID-Sized cars around)! DISLIKE lack of seat adjustments, not big on it's looks, and inability to turn off traction control :("
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"My Thoughts On The Prius   Technology- Navigation system, Backup Camera, Digital Interface, Smart-Key System, Hybrid. Appearance- Interior: Spacious room for size. Build Quality: Sound Fun Factor: Pretty Fun (Electric/Stalker Mode, Good and smooth acceleration, responsive breaking) (Steering doesn't feel like you're feeling the road as much as just driving on it)."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"First Time Driving A Prius   First drive in a Prius. Florida summers aren't the best laboratory for hypermiling -- motor kicks on all the time with the AC on. Good use of space, and very roomy. Think I remember reviewers saying there is huge glare on the information screen, which is true. Must be placed at the wrong angle, or the windshield goes too far back. Not ready to go out and buy one, but curiosity is satisfied. Would be interested to see how the updated 2009 model drives."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Toyota Prius 2008   Our Prius has been great, we've owned it now for over a year and haven't had any trouble with it. The exterior is very attractive and the interior has tons of room. We are all about 6'2'' and there is more than enough room for 4 very tall people in our family to ride in the car comfortably. It is fun to drive and has many nice features like back-up camera, bluetooth,etc. But the best thing about the Toyota Prius is the great gas milage that we get!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"The Title Of The Car? I Don't Have It. Not Quite Paid Off Yet   Since most of you have gas guzzling SUV's and fill up every day, let me remind you that there are more fuel efficient cars out there. On 10 gallons I can cruise for about 525 miles before the next fillup. I average 50 mpg. Need I say more? But I must write 50 words or more. I think I made it."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,The Dream Pruis   great gas mileage! It us very fun to drive because you know that you can drive all over and still get great gas mileage. Which is good because it saves you a lot of money! So you should buy a new prius today or tommorow or when ever you want to.
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great City Car   This little car has been so fun to drive. It is reasonably peppy, holds our whole family, including a big German Shepherd and is a wonderful CITY car. It is not bad on freeways, but I have not yet taken it out on a highway. It's cute and fun and easy to park in the big city. We call it ""Chiclet"" because it looks like the little white gum drop."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Best Buy. Bit Expencive To Buy, But Cheap To Run.   The toyota Prius is meant for those who want comfort from their car instead of performance. IÇve driven with my prius up 60 mpg under 4l/100km ItÇs not a car for a test drive because you need to learn to handle it properly to save fuel. This is why the rewiews are so bad. Best car IÇve ever had."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,Best Commuter Car Ever   best commuter car ever - 55mpg on my 40 minutes commute in the city. just get to 35mph and then it runs on electric. seats are very comfortable and there is a LOT of room in the back - not much for shoulders (not enough for 3 adults i fear) but legroom is impressive !
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Love It!   I love our car! It gets over 50mpg!! Seriously! It is the Package 5, so it has every option available. The tan leather is beautiful. We had the windows tinted and they look awesome, especially with the white paint. The only thing we would change is the navigation. You can't use it when the car is moving, which is terrible. Love everything else about this car!!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,Amazing   I have had this car for a little over a week and I love it. I have the backup camera and smart key system and they constantly amaze me. It's my new toy!
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Solid Car, One Of Toyota's Best. Yet, They Still Have All The Old Problems...   Like the headline. its a solid car, and its one of Toyota's best. but the old problems are still there. really annoying beeping sounds, an inaccurate camera for the only thing to help you when you are backing up, and a volume limit to the stereo... why the hell are they limiting the volume?!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"I Love My Prius, Especially Helpful With The Sky-rocketing Gas Prices. :)   Very reliable car...easy on the wallet when it comes to filling it up & it looks nice too. :)"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"2008 Toyota Prius   I like how my car handles. My previous car had issues making a simple turn (i.e. the turn radius sucked) but with this one I can whip in and out of parking spots without issue. I love the backup camera, the fact that it's low emissions, and that I get about 47MPG."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great Little Car For Getting Around Cities And On Longer Trips   Traded in my minivan just in time to see gas prices skyrocket. Prius is great for gas mileage, parking and even long trips. I do miss the ease of putting things in a minivan, but everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Not as good at cooling hot California summers as my Honda, but the gas pump is in charge!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,Wow   44 mpg - need I say more?
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"A Solid Choice For A Comfortable, And Efficient Cruiser.   The car is smooth and has a quiet ride. The 1.5L gas engine can shudder a bit when first activated at low speeds and be a tad raspy. But combined with the electric motor, the overall effect is low noise levels. The front seats are very comfortable, and there is plenty of legroom for both front and rear seat passengers. The rear passengers will suffer from tight headroom, but leg and hiproom is plentiful. I've been averaging over 50 mpg in the occaisons that I've had to drive the Prius. It's a solid buy."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Great Mileage And Better For The Environment   Gas mileage, 50 summer, 43 winter (the gas engine runs more in the colder weather to keep the engine warm). I can go anywhere from 430-500 mi. on a 10 gal tank, depending on the season. The car handles surprisingly well. More than adequate acceleration for getting on highways, etc, but once you are beyond 60, passing acceleration just isn't there. Pretty well appointed for the price. I have package 4, which includes Premium stereo and Bluetooth. It's larger than I would have thought, and while I can't load up like an SUV, with the back seats folded down, I can get a fair amount of stuff in there. I highly recommend it for anyone that has a hefty daily commute (I travel 85 mi. miles round trip each day). Also interesting to note that you get better mileage in heavy traffic or city than you do on the open highway (at slower speeds, the car runs more on electric than gas). I am definitely pleased with teh car and would buy another in a minute. The 2009 will be the next generation...can't wait to see it!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,I Love This Car   54 mpg!! and there is enough room for 3 kids and a full cart of stuff from Costco!
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"A Fabulous, Fuel Efficient Vehicle   I purchased my '08 Prius mostly to take a step in helping the environment. The 44 mpg that I have been receiving was just the beginning. My Prius is spacious, comfortable and has a nav system that brings you into the 21st century. I have also read that it produces 70% less polutants than other vehicles in its class."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Awesome Gas Mileage   I got this car mainly for the gas mileage, 46 mpg around town. It actually rides very nice and I have enjoyed all the options on it. I wish it has a power driver's seat."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Fun To Drive   Easy to handle, back up cameria and IPod port is great -- installed a Sirius Radio makes the drive to work more fun."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Amazing Technology   Great hybrid car. Test drove a Prius and was blown away with the technology, and interior room."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"The Car Is Great   Everything about the car is what is adveertised and more. HOWEVER, the navigation system is awful. They tried to do to much and it is impossible to use. Some simple things are easy but mostly impossible to understand. I have tried to use the book that came with it, went to the dealer and got a DVD that is to explain things but nothing works. I would like to have some kind of a chat room where owners that have solved individual problems could share this information. For example I put in an address but can not attach a name to go with it. So if you have several addresses in your city you don't know which one goes for ""Bob's house"" for an example."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Good Car, Packages A Little More Complete Than When We Bought A 2004   The vehicle hasn't changed efficiencies, it was just rated higher than reality before, which the EPA has remedied. Batteries estimated to go 8 years, 80,000 have lasted for almost all service vehicles more than 250,000 miles. I got about a thousand dollar discount through Costco which was not available when demand exceeded production. Oh, no seat heater but there are aftermarket solutions. You'd think an electric car would have an electric seat heater, after all it's got an electric air conditioner."
2008,Toyota ,Prius,'07 Got Better Mpg Then '08! Otherwise I Love '08 Touring   Leather distributor installed liqucell seat covers were wrinkled. I think the design and handeling is very stable with the VSC and tuned suspention of the Package Level 3 Toring. The stereo is fairly unbelievable sound and no need for CD's I Pod plugs in and plays over the JBL. Definitely go for the tint package and vehicle shield good values in my book. Also as an American born in Tokyo I love saying goodby to the gas sstations and GOOD BUY to my friends.
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Think ""green"" & Our Ecology!   We just love this car. It's been remarkably dependable as it is of a new technology, that of an electric/gas ""hybrid"" vehicle. Four doors and lift-back for a family it's perfect, in that respect, with plenty of room in the back for transporting from the store to our home. Seems to have more room in the rear than for tall people with ""long legs"" up front, but does accommodate a six foot individual. We're older now so speed isn't a big deal to us as power isn't a strength of this car although cruising speed would surprise many, and such a quiet drive, many people new to this car may think it stalled-out because it's just so quiet. The gas mileage and savings in money while doing something good for the environment is it's main assets. The world is changing for the better. We just love our ""Prius""!"
2008,Toyota ,Prius,"Excellent Value Overall...superb Gas Mileage!   This is a car we will keep till the wheels fall off. It currently has 176,000 miles on it and has original hybrid batteries and auxiliary battery. So far nothing major to report on it. We've replaced the tires 3 times since ownership. Currently have 90k-rated Michelins on it but something is causing extra wear on the front tires. I'm going to have alignment checked on it soon. We change oil every 3k-5k miles. Thinking of switching to synthetic blend. I checked the oil dip stick after 3k miles of driving it and it still looked good like it just changed the oil on it."
2009,Toyota ,Prius,Vin.2009 Priushybrid Car   i am tall and sometimes the leg room in the front seats was feeling a little uncomfortable other than that all is great with this car. Overall my family liked this car.. and its my wife's favorite car. My kids enjoyed it too.
2009,Toyota ,Prius,"Its A Fine Car. I Would Recommend It To Others   There is nothing really wrong with this car. It's physics that are holding it back. It's 'just enough' and very reliable. Not a race car, not a hauler, great for in town commuting. Feel good if someone in your family gets one. Just hope you don't end up being the one driving it, it'll ruin your rep as a tuff guy."
2009,Toyota ,Prius,"The Way It Drives And The Driver In Full Control   This car is excellent car when you drive it Every thing works in perfect condition. Saving A lot of gas good for student , take you to work Bring you back home safe very low in maintenance Cost you don't have to visit the mechanic so Often."
2009,Toyota ,Prius,"I Hope To Drive It For Many Years To Come!   The best car I have ever owned period! Beautiful dark blue with every option! Saving $60.00 a month on gas!Very fun and save to drive,best i have ever had in the snow!This is the right car for me!!"
2009,Toyota ,Prius,"It Does What It's Suppose To Do   It Does what it says it does, and all the tech gagets make it cool... I don't really like the look esp the liftback and the chrome tail lights. But it is the best MPG around! Cost of Ownership is what it's all about at this point."
2009,Toyota ,Prius,"Sandi's Toy   Wifes car, her second one, Sandi liked her '05 so much that she wanted another one. its green like a hybrid aught to be, nav is cool (she calls it carcar) and its a blast to try and get 50+ mpg! makes up for my buicks mpg"
2009,Toyota ,Prius,My Prius   The Prius is great for what it is- a hybrid. I needed a car that got good gas mileage when I was driving 200 miles per day. I tend to average around 45 mpg. The acceleration is a bit slow but I have an IS F for that. The main thing is this car can go twice the distance of my 4runner approx. 500 miles on less than half the tank 10 gallons vs 23 gallons for the 4runner. If I don't have need for this car in the next 60 days I will be getting rid of it though.
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Car   Purchased card with 80,000 miles on it. Now at 170,000. Cannot say anything bad about this car. Only repairs: replace wheel bearings $500. Holds lots of people and cargo. Interior trim has held up very nicely with practically no visible signs of wear(as compared to our Kia SUV with 'cheap' trim that easily scratches etc.) Based on my experience, if a mini van is for you, this car is an excellent choice."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"The Siennaexcellently Built Car. You Cant Go Wrong With It.   If you need a reliable family car, then the Toyota sienna is the perfect choice. It comes with great reliability, good cargo space. As for maintenance, well lets just say you never have to empty your pocket or wallet for that."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Fast For A Minivan   Amazingly quick for a minivan: 0-60 in 6.9 seconds. 0-100 in 17.7 seconds. Puts out 266 HP Could use fully independent suspension in corners, but handles well. Gets 19.3 MPG average for me, but I live in a mountain range, so it could do better. Get's something like 26-28 highway. Instruments are sharp, but don't feel connected to the rest of the interior, unlike most of Toyota's cars. Interior parts feel plastic and cheap. Lots of cup holders that are strangely handy. Hold tons of stuff and takes abuse. Lots of abuse. A few recalls, but fixed by Toyota quickly. All seats either come out or fold down to become something like an under-powered flat-bed truck. Does okay-ish in the snow with proper tires. I would recommend the AWD XLE for snow trips though. Oh yeah, and its ugly; unlike the new one."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Good For The Family Man..   tough,plus u get the former no1's badge on your grille...efficient in city,monster on the highway.....lovve it....space,comfort is good,legroom,headroom is good..only thing lacking is the boot size and the third row thigh support.."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Outstanding Vehicle- Our First Mini-van, But Definitely Far Better Than We Expected...   Excellent vehicle. Combined MPG averages in mid 20s. The 266HP V6 leaves the Honda and others in the dust- 0-60 in a tad over 7 seconds will thrill the kids! No squeaks or rattles- its a van so styling is what it is... 20000 miles and nothing but oil changes..."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,Love My Sienna!!!   This is a great family car. I can carry two large dog crates and my son in complete comfort. Acceleration is a little sluggish and the drive-by-wire isn't fun. Love the DVD player for my kid. Just what I wanted in a minivan!!
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Pretty Nice Family Car   Pretty sweet mini van. The sienna LE or XLE woulda been better, but if you want a good car without any of the extras, this would be the one to get. I think that overall toyota is a pretty good brand and also the sienna is a good family car."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"It Is Really Big And Roomy But Is A Gas Hog.   the exterior is pretty basic,the interior is huge. the XLE model has powered rear doors and trunk and is really comfortable and has side,front impact, and curtain airbags. handling and perfomance is awesome it is a v6.it is a great van."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,Drives Like A Sports Car - Honest   Good gas mileage; smooth handling; very quiet; individual a/c controls for all seats; middle seats come out; 3rd row seats go flush into the floor;power everything...it spoils ya!
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Nice Ride, Cargo And Passenger Space-a-plenty   This minivan rides very nicely. The driver has a very good view of the road. Seats are comfortable for big and/or little people. The 3rd row seats split and each folds down into the floor with one hand. The second row seats turn into tables or can be removed but do dont stow away into the floor, however, they are relatively easy to remove and install. The cargo area is big enough for full sheets of drywall or plywood to lay flat and the dual rear sliding side doors make getting in and out a breeze. The rear doors also have windows that go down all the way! The basic sound system rocks! I went to a tailgating party before a concert and plugged my laptop in for a video session which was very cool."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,The Color Of Money... From Gas Savings   High MPG's and excellent handling for a minivan. The cargo area can fit a full sheet(s) of plywood or drywall flat on the floor.
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,The Best Mini Vanvan   My sienna is dark grey and looks really nice compareded to those other crap boxes. It has a great engine (Im not joking) It is so big it can fit my kart!!!
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Vehicle In Almost Every Way   Love the minivan, so usable, so flexible. My wife enjoys it very much. It has great interior flexibility and is nice to drive. Loved it on a long trip."
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,Love Everything But The Way It Shifts   when slowing down to almost stop and then step on gas it feels like trans slipping
2007,Toyota ,Sienna,"Very Impressed   Plenty of room,Luxury ride and trim and fully loaded with entertainment ,dvd system makes for an all around enjoyable and comfortable ride for the entire family.The all wheel drive is super in the snow and icy weather.Nice looking to."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Family Car, Comfy For Long Trips, Can Haul Anything   I like everything about this car. I wanted the option of sliding the middle row seats together, so the car seat wasn't right next to the door. The 3rd room is a split row, so you can put either side down or both, which is awesome. There are more cup holders than seats."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Family Van For All Occasions.   I would recommend this van to any family. You can't beat all the safety features and the reliability of a Toyota. As with any front wheel drive minivan, really watch your tire rotations as they tend to chew through the front tires with all the weight, power, and steering being on the same axle. Would buy one again. The transmission is solid but with so many speeds it always seems to be searching for the right gear...never had a problem with it, it's just kind of annoying."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,Good Value In A Minivan.   The best thing about this van specifically is the AWD. It goes through the snow with ease and confidence. The power is good and the handling is the best in a minivan (we've had a 4 other minivans so far). The only real negative is the gas mileage. It is common for it to dip down to 17-18 mpg.
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,Great Family Car   Great familar car allowing carrying many kis + shopping Can add bicycles and any other large equipment Good power on road and very good comfort Maybe a bit noisy when on highway Otherwise excellent and safe car To recommend for anyone
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Family Car   Loved the rear seats being able to fold up easily and 3rd seats disappear into the back without taking them out of vehicle. Great rear air, zippy take acceleration, like middle console between front seats. Over all very happy with this vehicle."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,"Awesome Minivan.   PROS I'm a new dad & Minivan w/ the convenience package is awesome. Power slide doors + lift gate. Loading the baby seat is so much easier than having a sedan. Backup camera almost seems like a must. being able to control back climate is awesome! Whether on freeway or surface roads, the ride comfort is great. Generally quiet and very smooth. I've test driven the 2008 odyssey EX-L I felt that the sienna had a smoother ride. Among the 2008 minivan designs, the car looks more luxurious. I would say that the exterior design of the odyssey looks more complete, however odyssey interior is tacky startrek like. the interior of the sienna is not spectacular but just better than what i've seen in other cars. Having a minivan with that much space is awesome. Fit full grill (gift for dad) + stroller & pack & play and our own bags for a weekend trip.... easy. CONS The handling could be much better. I think they lose on the stability by trying to have more ride comfort. You can feel the sway on corners. The turn radius is no problem, I can make a U-turn anywhere my camry can. But you just feel like you have so much less control. I believe the hondas have better stability on corners. Going up hill the new bigger engine sounds like a truck engine. Some what loud. When cruising, it's quiet. I think the brakes could be better. It's one of those, they're not bad and I don't think of them too much, but they don't impress me at all and sometimes I wish they were better. Price: the CE & LE models are well priced. But XLE & Limited are way more expensive. It makes sense though for a reliable and well built car. i dropped a pretty penny for my 2008 Limited."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,"A Great Vehicle   I don't like that it is FWD vs. AWD, and that is why I am changing cars (although I got new tires this past fall and that made winter driving a breeze; it handled very well). I love driving the car - comfortable, good acceleration. It is roomy and very comfortable for the whole family (the dual power doors are wonderful and so convenient). This car has been maintenance free (oil changes)."
2008,Toyota ,Sienna,It's A Minivan For Gods Sake!!!   With 3 kids you need one
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,"Momma's New Ride.   I cannot say any negative comments on the Toyota Sienna. It looks great, runs great, rides great, gets great gas mileage. It has all the amenities of your living room in it. Kids love it. Great cargo capacity. The only thing lacking it a spare tire."
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,"Possibly The Best Muv Available In India (up To Rs 11 Lakh Bracket).   Innova has good performance and already have huge sales in india. People are excited about the capacity of the car. We guys were 9 in the car for whole of the trip(ie almost 2000kms). Now the Specs. Toyota Innova are powered by 2.5L, 2494cc with Turbocharger. This engine, too, delivers high engine performance with excellent fuel efficiency."
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Buy   Great car for the family, plenty of room for the kids, plus strollers and awesome for road trips. Comfortable seating and power side doors are very helpful when your hands are full. Overall, a great car for the family. Having this much space is awesome!"
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,"Acceptable   It has great acceleration, great handling, it has dodgy build quality, handles on the back squeak, and are loose, air conditioning is poorly ensembled, gas mileage is pricey, the boot lid has glitches, which might be because of the sensor, toyota has good maintenance costs and is quick and it sure is fun and easy to drive"
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,"Great Van   Ultimate family cruiser with all the options to make those long road trips with the kids easy. It even has built in shades on side windows to cut down on glare. The nav works great, put a movie in and the family is set."
2009,Toyota ,Sienna,Possibly The Best Muv Available In India (up To Rs 11 Lakh Bracket).  
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Excellent Overall Truck   Excellent overall truck. Very reliable. The towing capacity and power is pretty low, but is to be expected from a mid-size truck with a four cylinder engine. The look is great, and it is a very fun vehicle to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Great Truck   I am really impressed with how well built this truck is. I haven't had a single problem with it in the past two years of owning it. The power is there when you need it and it handles great around sharp corners.
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Reliable Family Truck   Easy loading and unloading of furniture, home improvement materials. comfortable double cab with plenty of room for 4 or 5 people. decent gas mileage -20-21 mpg average. plenty of giddy up with the V6 motor. handling was great especially in traffic."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Nice Truck   Very comfortable to drive and ride in. Sits up nice and high for a mid-size truck, although this style of Tacoma appears to be significantly bigger than the original Tacoma. Only issue is with wind noise... or I'd rate 5 stars; Nicest truck I've ever owned (and I've previously owned Datsun, Dodge, GMC and Ford.)"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Silver Surfer   i loved everything about this truck...it has surpassed all expectations! the only down side to it is the fact it did not come with an aux cable hook up. this has since been corrected in all newer models. i recommend anyone comparing smaller V6 pick ups to test drive one of these bad boys first!
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Very Impressive, What A Deal!   Look and feel were great. Engine was clean and well kept. Brand new tires and new full size spare too. I was very surprised at how well the paint was, you could tell it has was kept in a garage for sure."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"It Is Excellent   It has a good accelaration. The amount of gas by miles are 27 City/ 32 HW This car is very fun to drive you jump a lot :) Is very nice the interiro and the exterior,too It has HID XENON BLUE AND WHITE LIGHTS --"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"The Beast   Great handling, interior room, load capacity, but you can't get a class 4 aftermarket hitch for it even though it comes with one from the factory. There ought to be a law against that! Other than that, rides like a truck and handles like a car. Would buy another if it hauled more, but maybe looking at a Tundra"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Like It A Lot   Its has good acceleration, not bad braking. Handling is good for a truck. Turns good. It hasnt needed any repairs yet. Looks good inside and out. Its a 4 cylinder instead of the v6 so its good on gas. this car is very fun to drive wehether speeding or cruising."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Great, Economical   Silver Toyota Tacoma regular cab. I am the original owner. Excellent condition, no problems. Only used for commuting. * A/C, * Radio/CD * Automatic Transmission * Very economical * Free and clear title. * Low mileage at ~57k miles. Blue book private party value is over $13000. This truck drives very nicely."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"2wd 07 Taco   Its got guts even at highway speed. good control. built tough, have not had any trouble with body or styling. wishing 4wd was in the cards when we got it but its more important to haul the kids now. all in all i wouldn't trade it for anything short of the same thing with 4wd."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"I Think This Is The Best Truck Toyota Has Made In The X-runner Trim   The truck is always an eye catcher and the drivability is wonderful. Being a some what lowered truck with tight suspension, it bunches a little. The motor is very powerful and fast! Loving the X-runner in black, next color choice would be Red..."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Work Truck   Umm, it's my work truck. It was either this or a Ford Ranger... Performance is horrible...0 to 60 in about 5 minutes, but once you get up to speed it keeps going, especially going down a hill. Uphill is a different story. Perks are that the air blows cold, the turn radius is amazing, and ...umm. That's it. With a stronger motor, and maybe if the company would put a few more dollars out for an extended cab, this would be a nice truck! Working out of this thing for 10+ hours a day is nothing short of frustrating when it comes to having enough space."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"American Top Three Auto Makers Could Learn A Lesson Or Two From Toyota   Rides like a luxury auto with great gas miliage and plenty of towing capacity. Off road performance is Awesome. As with other Toyota drivers I know, gas miliage is better than listed on the sticker. Drive it...buy it. <:) Now"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"A Great Truck For Many Purposes   The truck feels very light, love it or hate it. It runs perfectly, never had an issue. Go every couple moths to get a 75 service. This truck pw3ns in so many ways, except for the fact that the back seat is really cramped"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Good   The acceleration a little weak but the gas mileage is great. The brakes are a little soft. car is low maintenance. The interior is simple yet sturdy. This is a very fun car to drive. Having the taneau cover is a must.
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Best Truck Ever Built   Probably one of my favorite purchases ever. This truck has preformed to the best of my expectations and looks awesome while doing it. Towing is great as well at 7000 pounds an the only downside is fuel economy at 10 mpg towing full load.
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"X Runner Review   Sexy ride. Awesome to drive, fast, handles decent. I would recommend putting at least 20 inch rims on the X runner to really get the best low rider looks. Gets a lot of looks and it is a blast to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Its Is An Ok Truck.   The thing is all over the place on the high ways or on any road for that matter, the clutch is slipping again which i replaced at 2500 miles and its only got 11k on it now. The frame is relatively week seeing as i hit a rock and snapped a support bar and i was going maybe 5mph.. I hit one in my mom's jeep doing almost 25mph and it didn't even dent a suppoert bar."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Gotta Love It   i love this truck. I have always liked tacomas, now i have one. It hase about 24000 miles, 4 wheel drive, a toolbox, tie downs, storage galore, more cup holders that i have cups, and a stereo that is AWESOME for being stock. I hope i get it paid off sooner that originally thought."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Love My Tacoma!   The only things I would change are the window lock button and stiffer seat belt buckles in the back seat. Other than that, I absolutely love it. I got a good deal and it fits my whole family - including a 4 year old and newborn. I absolutely love the storage bins in the bed to hold my straps - you never know when you might need them!"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Richy's 2007 Toy Taco Review   Accelaration good for a 4-cylinder truck. i have timed 0-60mph in 9 sec. flat. i'd say it needs bigger brakes although the brakes on it are decent. it could use a stiffer front sway bar and get a rear sway bar installed. Build quality great no manufacturer defects and i have over 25k miles on it. Maintenance cost is included in the warranty/ monthly payment/ but i added 2 inch taller tires and it makes the truck look lifted also these tires fit the truck. Gas mileage-20 to 28 mpg empty, 13-18 mpg towing. its a blast to drive, its zippy, good handling for a truck, good off road manners"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"The Best Truck I Have Ever Owned.   Great vehicle,good ride,superior handling,great options.Totally Totally Cool!"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"It Rocks !!!   Althought i work in the plant that builds this truck, and i have seen some confidential stuff about the truck, the truck overall is great. It looks bad ass and it performs nice. Again, this is not a sport car, so its was not design for racing. However, it is powerfull enough to take any race wanna be civic :)"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"I Love My Truck!   I love the awesome blue color, the 4WD, the 6 cd changer, the room, the short bed, the tow pkg, the coolness!!!"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Fun 4wd Nothing Too Big But Does The Trick Offroad   its a truck, doesnt need to be anything fancy because i hardly ever drive anything but the work truck it seems"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Speedway Blue X-runner   This is the best handling truck in the world in my opinion. The X-braced, sport tuned suspension can handle .9 g's in the skidpad."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"2007 Toyota Tacoma   2007 Totota Tacoma TRD Off Road w/ dual flowmaster exhaust,k&n 77 series cold air intake, and little interior/exterior mods. Many more to come. love the truck"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"My Blue Pearl   Great truck, grerat color, many mods, check out on my car domain page, the addres is: http://www.cardomain.com/ride/3010483 enjoy"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Fun Off Road   Very fun truck! Great sporty drive, aggressive suspension, impressive acceleration, (especially high end)"
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Excellent For The Price   I paid $34,470 out the door. I always loves Toyota truck. I hear strange revving between shift but more than anything I do not understand why Toyota TRD off-roader does not come out with higher clearance than this with all those excellent suspension."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Supercar Handling Trapped In A Trucks Body   This truck is not necessarily fast. It is quick but that wasnt the intent when designing this truck. To give you a comparison to how amazing the handling really is is that when Toyota designed this truck the benchmark for the handling was a Nissan 350Z. The truck has a bilstein suspension and x braces allowing it to pull a supercar like .93g's on the skidpad.
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Excellent Vehicle Except For Engine Vibration And Weak Rear Suspension   Very pleased with every aspect of the vehicle except for engine vibration or lugging - major fault IMHO. I expected 4 cyl performance, but I can't believe that Toyota would put a veicle on the road with this vibration or lugging. Dealer will not address the issue and avoids responsibility by saying that ""the vehicle operates as designed"". Also, the rear springs should be strengthened for heavier loads and stability."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Best Pickup In It's Class!   This truck is a great overall mid-size truck. If you want a nice looking, good performing, solid truck for work or for yourself, and you don't want to spend over 20K on a new car, then this truck's for you. I have one in silver which I got for 18K. Although it could use more power since it's only 4 cylinder 2.7L, the engine it does use is a WORKHORSE, and has been used overseas in industrial and commercial applications for several years. In China, they've had these engines driving belts that pull massive quarry loads. I have made a few modifications to increase overall hp. I also threw out the small tires it comes with and added larger, more robust looking tires. The ride on this truck is excellent for a truck. The access cab has seats for two people that are good for short rides. I use my access cab as extra secured storage, but when I need to drive more than one extra person I can fit two more in the back. This truck is a beauty! The Toyota truck quality is still in play with this truck. The interior looks awesome, and well built...unlike Ford Rangers or Nissan Frontiers. The MPG is incredible for a truck this size. Besides price, this is why I went with a 2wd Access Cab 4 cylinder instead of a 6 cylinder Taco. I get 20-21 city mpg's, and 24-26 highway mpgs on this truck. In conclusion, if you want a beautiful looking truck inside and out, of good quality, with a comfortable ride, a workhorse of an engine, a truck that will last for a loooong time, and you don't need to tow heavy trailers or do off-roading, then go for this Tacoma."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"This Truck Has Everything I Want.   I've owned this truck for 5 months now and I can't find a single flaw. It has the power, handling and looks I want. It is a very well built, solid truck."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Fun Truck To Drive!   I've had my Tacoma for almost 7 years now! It's performance and reliability comparing to other trucks is tremendous. The acceleration, braking, and handling is at the top of the game. No mayor repairs yet, the usual; oil changes, new brakes, exaust system, new tires, and a few detail body work. It's styling is good, not to a point that it needs a new paint job, but I like my gray truck and it's features. Gas mileage has been a little rough since you all know gas prices haven't been all that cheap, but it is manageable and I can depend on my truck in a long trip. The maintanance costs are affordable and haven't been a real issue for me! It's a fun truck and I am delighted to drive it every where I go. I've always wanted a Toyota Tacoma and now that I have wil never let it go! Of course, once the family grows, I will have to get a bigger car, but my Tacoma will still be there."
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,Phenomenal   This was my second Tacoma. I'm on my 3rd now. Not because I had any issues with any of them but because I just love the Tacoma. Smooth ride that has improved with the 3rd and plenty of power for the average person.
2007,Toyota ,Tacoma,"I Like Enough To Put Up With It.   It is a truck so obviously the acceleration, braking, and handling are only just enough to get it moving. Being a Toyota the build quality is excellent and I have not needed to do a single thing to since I got it besides regular maintenance. The styling really doesn't appeal to me, but I will say that it is the best looking small truck on the market. Again it is a truck, but for a truck it does get decent gas mileage and you really don't have to worry about anything going wrong with it. Once more it is a truck. Fun to drive? No, at least not in my opinion it isn't."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,Love My Tacoma   This has been a great truck for my husband. He drives to Dallas every day and it sits high and gets great gas mileage for him. He purchased it with 45K miles and it now has 150K+ and we still have many years that we can get out of it. It is a great vehicle.
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Best Mid-sized Truck Out There.   Great looking truck. Very comfortable ride. Toyota reliability. 245 stock HP. With a good set of tires... there's no snowstorm that can stop this truck. Turning radius has a lot to be desired, but all in all the Toyota Tacoma is one of the best vehicles you can buy."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Tacoma   Great truck. Love the way it drives, off-roads. Handles loads really well. I really wish that Toyota would fix the squeaky blower fan on low and the leaf springs. Also I want them to put out a disel version in the US!!"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Have Had No Real Problems In 4 Years And 65000 Km   Good truck overall, but a full-size gets similar gas mileage with more size and capacity. Good head room in the front. Not much leg room in the back seats but they are deep so they are still pretty comfortable. Four wheel drive system works very well with the front having a locking diff. It is a bit light in the rear end though so it rides a bit choppy when empty."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Quick Sexy Truck.   great truck, fast nimble and easy on the eyes. not so good at hauling items but great at hauling ass. and paired with the 6psd manual its fun to drive. onlt had a couple of problems in my two years of owning but nothing too bad."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"With Just 42964 Miles, This Car Is Barely Broken In   it has got a SR5 Package including criuse control ,power everything,keyless entry. Off -Road package ,Locking Rear Differential, off road tires all round. One of the best 4x4 I've owned ,very low miles alwways garaged and meticulously-maintained. Great Off -Roader"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Love It!   Long bed holds a couch (which is bad when friends find out), towing package is enough for small loads (including a small ski boat), and room for 5. Better than a car, and goes places a larger truck can't. Very fun truck to drive."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Best Compact Truck On The Market.   I bought my 2009 Toyota Tacoma X-Runner about two weeks ago and I love it! The ride is smooth, and the looks are great, a real head turner. The 6 speed transmission is smooth and very forgiving, I haven't driven a straight stick in awhile and was a little rough at shifting, no problem with the 6 speed. The acceleration is quick and the handling beats most sport cars I have diven in the past. I wanted a truck for hauling stuff when I need to and enjoy driving around town. This truck does both. The interior is refined but still get the feel of a truck. I think it is the best street truck on the market. You get the best of both worlds, trucking and touring. The gas mileage is not that good but mirrors other compact trucks. No regrets here!"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,2008 Tacoma My #1 Pick   I absolutely love this truck. Recommend it to everyone! Wouldnt trade it for anything. Unbelievably fast for a small V6 truck and impressive pulling power. Best body style Tacoma yet. Much more room inside than ever before.13 cup holders!! Oh...Dare ya to race me!
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Its Great For My Needs And Wants   Milage is about 20 highway, 15 city, and 10-12 with a 5x10 trailer. Not too shabby considering my last ride only got 14 mpg. Acceleration isn't so great, but what can you expect from a truck? Love the color, love the 4x4. I've owned it for a year and haven't had a problem with it yet."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,Best Truck On The Market   Great performing car. I love my truck because it doesnt drive like a truck but more like a smaller suv but still has all the capabilities of a powerful truck. Ive had it for over 2 years and it still drives just like the day i got it.
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Solid Built Truck.   solidly built pickup. I was on a budget, but if i had unlimited funds i probably wouldve gotten an acess cab v6 with 4wd....go out and offroad with it. With what i have, it will probably be dropped and we'll go from there."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Poor Quality   08 trd...acess cab....clunks going into 4wd, has been stuck in 4lo many times, and sometimes wont go in 4lo, vibration in 2wd at speeds 40-75km/hr, service cant fix anything...totally unhappy...had other toy trucks and loved them...quality definitely suffering"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Luv My Taco!!!   i love my truck, long bed 4 door 4x4 TRD... its loaded. i use it for work right now and sometimes i spend up to 7 hours in the seat and i never get fatuiged with those bolstered trd seats... performance is a little more than adequate, but i cant ask for too much when my pickup truck gets 22mpg!!"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Tacoma   I love my truck. Its just a basic Tacoma, but I think it runs great!!! It has excellent breaking. Its small for a truck so it doesnt have all the weight of a big truck or suv, so i think thats good. Its good on gas as far as trucks go. I dont have any problems with my truck."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,My 08 Tacoma 4x4 Access Cab   With the V6 and Toyota's VVI-T technology this truck has amazing acceleration. When you kick in into H4 or L4 you can just feel the torque as the truck crawls and digs into the pavement. Can't wait until this winter! I love the indigo ink pearl (Dark Blue) paint job. For a 4X4 it gets excellent gas mileage. It is truly the funnest vehicle I think I have ever driven. I would recommend the Tacoma to anyone looking for a midsized pickup.
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"'08 Taco   I love the rugged versatility, the attention to detail (especially with the many unlisted features on this truck) and the extraordinarily good gas mileage (22mpg city! much better then EPA ratings)"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"I Love This Truck.   This truck is awesome. I was going to buy one in about six months, but I just couldn't help myself. It has a lot of features, and seems more geared toward the offroad enthusiast rather than the street driver (which is what I wanted). Has a great towing capacity, and the 4.0L engine is much more powerful than the previous V6s used by Toyota in their Pickup/4Runner lines (i.e., you won't need the supercharger offered by TRD to give it some get up and go, but you might as well)."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,Loved The Truck Its   I am pleased with truck power ban but gas sucks & stereo it handles well but ride ia little stiff normal driving Truck has lots of potential for diffrent reasons I like a low Profile in which its setup already.
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Great Ride, Comfortable, And Power.   I had a Toyota 1994 xtended cab V4 for 13 years. Last week the engine blew at 177,000 miles. I decided to get a new truck. I now have a V6 Tocoma 4WD manual transmission. I like the comfort, power. It's a smooth ride and great acceleration. Good sound system. It's quite an upgrade from my previous truck"
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Toyota Reliability Shines   I enjoyed this truck's ride although a tad harsh. Fuel Economy is poor for such a small truck. The V6 is dated and inefficient but uber reliable. The tech is outdated as well but this was an 08. I recently bought a 2015 MUCH BETTER Technology and the SPORT rides better as well.. Toyota is resting on their laurels but the Nissan Frontier is a better choice on paper for a small truck today for the money, And I am not a Nissan fan at all. I love these little trucks. GM is not in the race IMO with the Colorado. GM has too many problems right now. I don't trust their designs and production for the long run. The Colorado looks bland and I just don't trust GM My Toyota Service Center is MUCH better and modernized. They discount everything for me having purchased three vehicles there. I would rather have an 08 Tacoma than a 2015 GM anything."
2008,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Sold>>>>>>hard To Give Up And Replace....very Hard Act To Follow.   I like driving a vehicle that does not depreciate and is extremely reliable. build quality is excellent. Has decent fuel economy when driving normally. Nice ride height, Very smooth for a truck. What can be said. Its a Toyota Tacoma. Never outdated. Never needs to be traded at wholesale prices. Never towed anything so could not rate that,"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Multitasking & Resourceful Ride   Space/compartments/overdrive. This truck can serve many purposes with day-to -day task. Great for hauling, moving, and transporting. The cab is truly meant for less than 3 folks, not more than 6 feet tall and under 200lbs. There's an awesome child safety seat behind the passenger seat. It was amazing to transport appliances great distance with minimum concerns."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Great Practical Car!   Very user friendly. Love the versatility and maneuverability. Lockable cover over bed! From shopping to holding personal items, always felt safe with this convenience. Cover is sturdy enough to stand on! Setup with a Trailer hitch and all electrical connections in place."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Toyota Value, Second To None!   We bought this Tacoma because we found a great deal and it is about as fuel efficient as you can get for a truck. The ride is excellent and the off-road capability is certainly there although we felt it was too nice to really take ""off road"". Toyota quality and reliability shines in the Tacoma and this truck was no different. Build quality is excellent, the seats are okay, but not the best I've ever sat in. Performance was as expected, plenty of power, great handling, and it always felt safe to ride in. A bigger bed would have been nice but we never had a situation where this wasn't big enough. Getting kids and car seats in the back seat was a breeze! All in all, nothing is perfect but this Tacoma is about as good as it gets for a well rounded small(ish) pickup truck!"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"09 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab   I like this car because it is practical, reliable and good looking. It will likely run forever, and does not cost much to maintain. It also has a tow package which is nice. The only real problem that I have with it, is that with the baby in the back seat in her car seat, it is hard to fit anyone infront of her."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Superb Car For Sports, Outdoor Use And Family Fun!   Very useful, dependable all around vehicle. Great styling and comfort. Well designed with excellent features for utility work and camping. Lots of compliments and I have used this truck in more ways than I mwould have imagined. Still running great!"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Worth Every Penny!   Smooth V6, consistent brakes, tight suspension (TRD Sport) rough on bumpy roads. Flawless build quality and solid. The best looking mid-size out there with aggressive (although non-functional) hood scoop. Decent gas mileage with highest in class tow capacity (6500lbs). Highly capable bullet-proof 4WD, plus the option of a dealer installed fully warranteed (5yr 120k) supercharger makes this by far the best mid-size. Not to mention the highest resale value of all pick-ups, not that you'd ever want to give it up."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Great Freakin Truck.   It a great running truck, rides nice, good performance, sharp looks, good gas mileage (could be better). Got the six speed manual transmission. Lots of clearance for different tire sizes at the stock ride hieght. There a Web sites that specialize in gear for just toyotas, making it easy to fing aftermarket parts."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"This Is A Great Truck For The Average Commuter.   This truck has been real good so far except for a minor radio issue at 3,000 miles that had to be replaced under warranty. Other than that I highly recommend this to any one!!! Goes anywhere and is very dependable"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"It's Great!!!   everything is nice about this truck ,lots of room.. good handling,gas milage is great for a truck, it rides nice. i know i got my money's worth.reliability is good, quality,it also looks smart. even the back up camera is great!!"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,Great Everyday Driver   Space - Small space on the rear seats. Performance - a 246 HP is nice but with the TRD exhaust system way better. Gas - its like drinking water. Build Quality - First month with it the radio stopped working. FAIL. Rough riding you can feel everything.
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,2009   I love my truck . it had tons of power and it looks great. the radio is okay. i had to get it replaced by Toyota . i think i bunch of peoples were messing up like mine also.i love the factory LED tail lights and the 5 speed auto transmission . it gets alright gas mileage it gets better on like back roads at like 55 miles then like 70 on the highways prob like an average of 18 or19. depends if i gas it allot on that tank of gas but i love the truck and its very fun to drive.
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,2009 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab   4 Cylinder engine makes it GREAT on gas but still remains a truck that you can pile stuff into. 5 spd manual transmission makes it very fun to drive. No problems with it. Great styling. Only downfall is the factory rims.
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Black Beauty!   It's black and it is named black beauty! It drives smooth, it has a newer design then the old toyotas in the 90's, it gets about 21 miles per gallon. it isn't too expensive to fix, it can move you places with out needind someone else to move your stuff."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Barcelona Red 2009 Toyota Tacoma   Acceleration, braking and Handling are great. Built very well, solid with no squeaks, rattles, etc., and takes bumps like a car. Good looking vehicle both inside and outside, nice package with bedliner, JBL stereo, back up camera in rearview mirror, etc and too many other features to mention. (SRS5 package) Gets 25 mph (2.7 L 4 Cyl) city and highway combined ,no maintenance needed so far. Fun to drive. Just a very solid and good looking medium size truck."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"It'll Be My Favorite Toy For Many Years To Come.   I'd say it drives like a car, but you don't feel the potholes nearly as much. Great acceleration, braking and handling. Even smooth at high speeds. Tons of muscle power, and practically flawless sturdy build. I get compliments on it all the time, and the interior puts most ""luxury"" cars I've been in to shame. Is it fun to drive? Oh yeah. I enjoy my commute to work now!"
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"Drives Like A Car   Drives like a car. Can tow up to 6500 lbs. fun factor? It is not called a Toy for nothing, it is a big toy to play with!! The best of both worlds: comfee as a car, tough as a truck."
2009,Toyota ,Tacoma,"09 Tacoma Prerunner Access Cab Sr-5, 2.7 L, Man Trans.   Build quality - Bad radio from the start. Turns off and on at will, changes radio tuning at will, mostly when hot and especially over bumps when hot. Waiting for replacement to come in under warranty. Told it could be a while as bad ones get refurbished and sent back out to replace other bad ones...problem appears to be not uncommon from what I can tell. Update - radio finally swapped out with refurbed one after over 2 months. And this was just before all the acceleration and stability issues that have come out on other models. (Seems a rash of quality issues/hiding problems going on corporately to me). Now I received recall notice for floor mat/gas pedal (there's plenty of clearance between them in my truck) and a mod to make sure if the brake is pressed, the gas will release. Performance - 2.7 in this size truck won't win any acceleration contests, but it helps on gas mileage. Have to downshift more often to accelerate than I've been used to in other vehicles owned. So far averaging 22 mpg in mixed driving. Highest 23.5, low 21. They really fooled EPA for that high sticker mileage which helped me greatly purchasing this under Cash for Clunkers by trading in a worn out 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Suggested improvement - really give those who aren't into rapid acceleration something to really love...4 cyl diesel with good performance (turbo?) for even better fuel economy would be cool."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Easy On Gas - Reliable   Good daily commute Car, Great on Gas. Very reliable vehicle, it was only in for General Maintenance, never in for any Breakdowns. Good warm weather car, fun to drive, didn't do well in Snow / Michigan Winters. Did Great in Arizona."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Small, Quick, And Comfortable Car   Car is great for long trips, has a lot of space to put things in it. For a toyota it's a stylish car. Has been the most reliable car I've ever owned. Also very easy to park in the city."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Mileage   great mileage with excellent power train but in windy situation in highway it shakes a lot. Very roomy interior for sedan, comfortable seating BUT driver seat without extra cushion (I use a couch pillow to seat on) is very uncomfortable Because of its angle/position due to bucket like seat."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Small But Plenty Of Space.   its a great car super economical runs great although is small you have plenty of space we keep up to date with it only was use for work only was driving ten miles a day or even less great DEAL for price
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris!!   typical small car, good on gas not enough power or torque. car look good if you do some customizations of your to it. i have subs and tinted windows and other small proformance and cosmetic things in to this car but overall is very reliable and a good car to get back and forth to work with and long drives if you can get past its lack of power."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Very Dependable And Economic   You will love this car. I have had for 4.5 years , I use it to commute to work. Excellent gas millage and very dependable. Very clean, drives smoothly.Very fun to drive. Selling only because I want to upgrade to a new car."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,2007   The Yaris 2007 2dr Hatchback was a great care. Of course the model has been re-designed and lost some of its internal sleekness. When I first got the machine I thought of it as being shaped something like a Science Fiction shuttle craft. I was stunned at how much equipment I was able to put in the back with the back seat folded down. It's major flaw or weakness was back sightlines were bad. It was hard to see behind no matter how tall or short you are.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Overall This Car Is Perfect   The toyota yaris sedan is a very nice family car. Its very nice,the shape is nice,its a affordable sedan.The drive of this car is very good and the interior is also nice.This car is available in two engines: 1000cc and 1300cc .You can use this car for years if you keep it in condition.The gas mileage of this car is very good.The quality of ths car is very good because it is made in japan.The maintenance of this car is not so expensive any one can afford it.This car is fun to drive because it is a sedan."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Excellent Commuter Car!!!   Excellent little Car! Would perfer the European diesel for better fuel economy. Very fun car to drive and still gets the thumbs up 5 years on. Maintanence has been minimal. Toyota service has been excellent. Owned about 25 cars and this is one of the best.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Rwar !   Good car. Not expensive to buy. The RS got a lot of power. The maintenance cost are pretty low. Front seats are like racing seats, very comfortable. Not a family car but it's ok for one or two persons. Like it !"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"The Slowrider   Cheap to own, cheap to mod, fun to drive, but don't expect fast acceleration. However, racing strips do make the car about 100 times faster. SSK lowering springs SRI Front tower strut bar and the rest is purely cosmetic work"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Gas And Economical   I like this car but since the miles are getting high, I am thinking of buying a new one. So far I have only had to get new tires and replace the brakes. I've had oil changes and fluids replaced at intervals. My Lab has his teethmarks on the seatbelt and several buttons."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Cute Yaris   Performance - Good acceleration, Build Quality - No need for repairs after 4 years driving Appearance - very cute Cost of Ownership - highly gas efficient, need basic maintenance Many storage space inside, compact size makes it ideal for downtown/street parking, good for parallel parking"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Convenient   I had my 2007 Yaris hatchback for about 4 years before I totaled it. Overall, I enjoyed this car. Performance wise, its a great car. I never had any mechanical problems with the car and it was great on mileage. I used while in my first 3 1/2 years of college and drove 200+ miles a week (commuting to school/work), which typically meant gassing up once a week for me. I mostly used it for college, which I would suggest this car for anyone who wants to save money on gas or unsure of what kind of car they'd need in college. This car can park almost anywhere in a parking lot or in spaces for parallel parking. However, if you plan on transporting stuff, I wouldn't suggest this car. The space in the backseats and in the trunk are very limited. With the exception of the lack of space the interior is pretty awesome. There are three glove compartments and roughly 9 cup holders in the entire car. The speedometer is located in the middle of the dashboard which is unconventional for most cars but is quite convenient for those who would like to backseat drive with you. The 2-door hatchback can be a hassle if you plan on driving more than one person in it though. This car is a great option if you want to save money or plan on driving primarily yourself or for commuting, but if you plan on having a family or know you'll be driving more than just yourself, I wouldn't suggest this car simply because there are plenty of sedans that are more spacious. Also bear in mind that when I totaled my Yaris, I was told this model is considered an ""expendable"" car, which means unless it is in great condition when you plan on getting a different car, don't expect to get too much for it, which makes sense because I only have seen corporations or businesses mostly use this model. Its a great investment and a great car for the most part, but I would not suggest it for long term use."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Belta   love the power i get from the 1300 engine VVTI and the CVT trans, the stock tyres feel too small for the car so im planning on a upgrade, any recomendations, so far it feels good punchingint down the highway, miss the 4WD of my 07 Sprinter"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Student Car..   Performance - Acceleration, handling && braking wee all amazing in this car.. It being so small she was my ""GO - Kart"".. Build Quality - This car is obviously Toyota's College/Student car.. Basic interiors && a front end made of tin.. Don't ask how I figured that out, It wasn't fun!! (LOL) Appearence - The cutest car on the face of the planet.. I do not like the smart cars but I find this car super cute!! Cost of Ownership - Non - exsistant.. Gasonline mileage.. I drove it everywhere && filled maybe twice a month @ approx. $40 per fill... Fun Factor - For it being my little GO - Kart it was tonns of fun.."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Great For The Price If You Cant Get Your Hands On A Fiat 500 Or Panda.   Wicked good bargin for a used one with middle miles. $ spd auto is fun to shift and with one person in the car its really snappy of the line. Suspension leaves a little to be desired with squishy cornering and higher stance but with a few tweeks it can be a pocket rocket. Interior is fun and functional with the ever famous toyota center dash display. Cubbies everywhere can lead to secret stashes being forgotten. lol. Seats are very supportive and the car is great for road tripping.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,.   I bought this car so i could get around realiably. It has been a very good car with decent gas mileage. I am not really mad that i bought the car however. It gets me where i need to go.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Could Do Better.   Often forgotten, the Toyota Yaris is a rather competent sub-compact hatchback. Though it's not as sporty as its competitors, it's still fairly maneuverable in tight confines and very responsive. Build quality and fit/finish are just average, but cost of ownership is excellent thanks to best-in-class fuel economy and affordable spare parts."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great From A - B All The Time   bring your tazz, golf 1.4, uno, small car competition exels to great hights. comfort you'll never imagine from the outside as a hatch. small engine but thanx to vvt power is just good enough. cant go wrong with toyota. just dont smash it, ask me."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Little Car!   Build Quality: 127000KM and not a problem Car Comparisons: considered the ""Fit"" and ""Versa"" but this is better all around, more space, more power, more refined drive Performance: it will do 200kmh at top end or you can set the cruise to 105 and get 50mpg all day long More About My Car: DON'T fall for the hype. Toyota makes awesome littl"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Get Something That Is Easier To Fix.   I really wanted to love this car. She looked good, was great for city driving and was cheap to run. Then, one night, I had an incident with a kerb. After seven attempts to get the steering and wheel alignment fixed, the Toyota dealer and I both gave up. They suggested that I get a new car and I got an Alfa. Having driven Toyotas for 12 years of my life, the Yaris is responsible for the fact that I will probably never own a Toyota product again."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"I Just Love My Car.   Good gas mileage, and cheap maintenance. Fun to drive, soft and comfy (in its price range) Wish it had a better acceleration. But it takes me where I want to go, and keep me from riding buses and walking down the rain."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Gotta Love My Little Blue!   Manual, great acceleration considering its 106 hp, light-weight, very fuel efficient, even more so since I switched to synthetic oil, excellent braking, 3 years on the road brakes still look brand new, excellent cornering and manoeuvering, precise steering, very reliable."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Go For It   0-100 in 11 sec. very stable, more than 320 km per 20 leters, very wide inside, sporty, very easy to handle, very responsive, lots of storage area, wide trunk, no heavy, it's for every day use, travelling and racing."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Today, Tomorrow, Toyota   Performance - Well u can't expect a lot from a 1.3 but I'm thinking of tuning it up to get more power out of it. Starting with an ECU remap and take it from there. Build quality - Toyota Styling - Average but with a lot of potential and readily available parts for cosmetic modifications Cost of ownership - Like I said before..it's a 1.3 and it's a toyota. U do the maths Fun factor - 7/10 - Good car from the factory and can be improved a lot by a good engine and driveline tune up with the correct suspension setup. Again a good tuner car"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Get It!   40mpg in the city, can't beat that.. Short trips with the family out of town are also incredible, can get to more then 50MPG on the highway, not much space for luggage, but a good roof rack can solve that problem."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris   It's small, too small for a larger person like myself. But, it is a good ride, it's cheap on gas, and not bad overall. The cargo in the hatchback is small though, unless the seats are folded down, the sedan is more recommended by me."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris!   Its a very "" cute"" car. Yaris's get excellent gas mileage, about 40mpg highway and 32mpg city. I have found it to have very low maintenance costs. Basically have just changed the oil every 5000 miles, and rotating the tires. 8"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"A Nice Little Car For The Money   Great on gas...it gets at least 35-40 miles per gallon, especially on the highway. the sound system is awesome which is great because i really like to crank my tunes!! it handles really well, no matter the weather."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"I Love My Car And Would Buy This Again And Again.   Love my car but I know it's not for everyone. It's super light, only 104 horses, and doesn't handle like a street rod by any means, but I trust the Toyota brand and I've had no major problems with it, only routine maintenance. I bought my car because it was cute and learned later it rocked with gas mileage and that I can park on a dime with it. It's small but roomy and I have had no problems getting where I want to go, in terms of acceleration or people not seeing me because of the size of the car. It might not be the coolest car around but it's fun and economical, which are not normally two things found together."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Rules   Pascual, the Lightweight Devil, a.k.a. bean. Dark green 0-100 Kph @ 6.5s 1.3cc Low consumption fast braking system Very low COI Fabric Custom front/side/back The car is very cool to drive, enough space for taking a great ride."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Worth The Money Paid For It.   The best car, the best mileage per gallon, simply put... GOTTA LOVE MY YARIS! A tank full of gas can go up to 2 weeks till empty. Remember that Yaris turns on a dime and runs wiht a nickel. Sincerely, An in-Yaris-love driver."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris   YARIS: not bad mileage- in local, 20mpg in new york city, 30+ mpg in florida not too easy to get a stable ride, it gets shaky and bumpy on a not-so-smooth road it can be kinda noisy on the highway"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"I Traded In My Ford Ranger As A Down Payment For A Second Yaris.   I love how Toyota moved the speedometer to the center of the dash. I installed my aftermarket navigation system behind the steering wheel. Love how the 3 door hatchback has 4 glove boxes. As a disabled person, I need things like automatic and power steering, which the Toyota Yaris offers. I got 35 mpg highway, which beats any other car I have ever owned."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Happy Customer   Solid little car with good poop for its class. Carries a lot of stuff. Well built with good service support from the Toyota dealers I've dealt with. Overall great customer experience owning one. Would buy again. Get the rear window wiper!
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"4dr Yaris Sedan 2007   Performance: What can I say? It's a Yaris...acceleration is non existant. Braking is good, mainly due to the use of disc brakes on a light car, and it's a fun car to throw around. Appearance: Some people like it, some don't Fun factor: If you can get over the weak engine, it's fairly fun to drive"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"The Yaris 4-door   Great A to B car due to mpg, which is about 35-37 combined city and highway. One of the cheapest cars to own. The 5-speed is a must for such a small engine and if you want to have any fun with the car."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Yaris 1.8 Sr 2007 5 Door   Not as qiuck as other modern hot hatches. The 130 bhp 1.8 VVTi engine produces a steady amount of torque across the range, but lacks a much needed power band to give it that sporty edge. If driven sensibly, the onboard economy calculator has read over 50mpg with luggage on board. Its not the best looking car about. The ride is quite firm all the time. Handling is superior to other cars I have driven in this class. The car sits on standard 17"" Yokohama rubber, which provides huge amounts of grip with the electronic traction and stability controls. These interfering aids however cannot be turned off. Because of this reason the car is not that inspiring to drive. It lacks that direct feel that is needed to drive enthuseastically. But with 9 airbags on board, its a safe way to go quickly."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"2007 Yar   I love this little car! I have 45,000 miles on it in 18 months. I get an average of 35-41 MPG. This car is PERFECT for roadtrips. It has been to Vancouver, San Francisco, Reno, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Sacremento and back. This summer, I averaged 39-41 MPG and that was driving in rush hour from Hugo to South Mpls."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"This Car Is The Best For Mpg.   Best car for these times of high gas prices. Its a standard with a stick shift giving 34/39 mpg!! What more can I ask for as a student! It seats 4 comfortably, but the handling is a little tighter on the highway, obviously for the lighter weight of the car."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"The Mighty Yaris   perormance: the 1.5l doesn't sound or accelerate like a v8 but the lightweight chassis makes up for that. build quality: it's a toyota. appearance: I like the sporty look for the sedan S. cost of ownership: great 4 door econo car!! fun factor: definately not a 911 turbo, yet still fun to drive."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"My Yaris   I love my car! It's cute and fun to drive (it's a manual). It gets great gas mileage and you can't beat the quality of a Toyota. I would enjoy more horsepower, but I guess that's the price you pay....or rather price you save...on getting the good mpg."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Yarrrr Yaris   handles like a go-kart in an ice skating rink. center mounted speedometer takes a few weeks to get used to. plasticy rattling noise is makes takes awhile longer to get used to. a fun car to drive and to see how many clowns you can squeeze into it at one time.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Little Economical Car That'll Save You Thousands!   Great on gas. Compact car appearance on the outside but roomy on the inside. Nice heavy doors. Sits higher than most mid-sized vehicles. Available safety package including ABS brakes. Even though a mid-console is an extra feature, it is definitely not needed. This car has tons of cup holders and neat little storage panels along the dash."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Little Fighter   acceleration is good for such a small car and small engine. interior is cute. gas mileage is AWESOME. at least 40 mpg highway even when driving over 60 mph. YES, it is fun to drive! Does u-turns fast and in tight spaces!"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Cute Good Looking Smart Small Little Car For A Single Person.   Love my car, will not drive any other car, than my little blue Yaris. Performance excellent. Long rides same as on a bike smooth and very soft. The seats are also very high and better than my Opel Corsa Lite."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"2007 Toyota Yaris   I love this car it gets great gas milege and I've had it for over 2 years without any problems. It currently have about 27,000 miles on it. This car is very fun to drive. i would recommend a stick to anyone looking at this patricular car however since it does have such a small engine"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"I Love My Car   I got my car a little over a year ago. It is brand new so it should be reliable. My husband has the same thing but in hatch back. His has 50,000 miles on it with not one problem."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"It's Alright   accelerates alright, would be much better faster haha. pretty good handling, good braking, solid built, looks pretty girly.... but watever. it's a car. i'm happy. has lots of room in it. not squished. comfortable seats. 40mpg"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Made Of Plastic   This was our work car for a while and it's horrible. The look of it isn't anything special but that isn't the problem. It feels like it's made of plastic. The ride doesn't feel precise around corners and the drivers seat was stupidly uncomfortable. Plus there was a significant delay when pulling away - it was a deasil.
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Good Little Commuter.   Spacious little car that is great for commuters. Engine is small and fuel efficient. Interior room is spacious, better than versa but not as good as fit. Handling is ok due to hatchback set up. Options are limited but effective."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Small Car, Big Heart   Perfect everyday car! Accelerates quite decently and handles nicely with stocked tires and even better with custom tires. Very Gas efficient and 5 bucks it will serious get you somewhere!"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,Great Hatchback   Good vehicle for storing MANY small items with all its glovebox pockets
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Small Hatchback With Great Performance.   This is a small hatchback that has a great performance. The 109 horses that comes out of its 1500cc 1NZ-FE VVT-i engine is also very fuel efficient. The engine runs very silently, but you could make it roar if you go above 3000RPM. The handling is quite okay and it's really fun to drive because of its light steering. The interior of this car is quite roomy. Sitting in the back seat is still enjoyable because of the wide legroom. 7 cup holders many storage compartments in this car can come really come in handy."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Love It   its a small 4 door, very zippy with 42 mpg."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"I Like My Yaris   This car has the best fuel milage available in the US for a non-hybrid vehicle. Handling is exceptional and acceleration is excellent. Interior is spartan but roomy and comfortable. I have been driving my 2007 Hatchback for over a year and have had no mechanical problems, and still enjoy it as much as the day that I bought it."
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Cheap, Economic, Practical.   This is really a great car, really made for the average everyday normal person. It has a low price tag, it's economic on gas, it has a lot of storage space. It's kinda confortable and of course, thanks to that toyota badge... It's supposed to be reliable. For now it did quite well, my mother baught it on July 2007 and has no problem at all and probably won't have! Now that's peace of mind!"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Fancy A Race... It Might Just Surprise You!!   This little beast is a decent warm hatch, 0-60 in 9 secs and great gearbox with short changes. Its got quite a few extras over standard models, like side skirts, sports seats, different more aggresive front & rear bumpers and unique to the T-Sport model a 105 bhp, 1.5 vvti engine!

2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"Good Little Car   I have a Zinc 1.3, it's a good reliable economical car, it's my second Yaris and there is a lot more space in this model, but i dont find it as econiomical or a smooth to drive as my last one the Yaris Blue"
2007,Toyota ,Yaris,"2005 Yaris/vitz Turbo   This Car I got in 2005. There is only 600 ever made, so this is pretty rare. One of the fastest cars I've ever driven... Small, light and quick.

TRD body kit etc. Interior: Bucket seats, A/C and lots of other little stuff"

2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Yaris 2dr Hatchback   Its a great car, I like how smooth its to drive and how comfortable its comparing to its size, its NOT the car for a family, maybe a family with one or two kids would be fine, I love how sufficient with fuel its, and very powerfull comparing with its engine size."

2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"A Good Family Car   The front fascia could be a lot better. The ride is a bit too hard, but handles well because of that. Interior is very nice and modern, quite spacious for a sub-compact. And the engine is very efficient yet powerful for it's size."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Fun Little Inexpensive Car   the reviews that I have read say that it doesn't handle very well, but I would completely disagree. It has such a short wheelbase, and weighs so little, that it handles quite well, and I plan on taking it out to the local autocross track. It rides very smooth, but is a little noisy on certain road surfaces. The acceleration is adequate, no problems pulling into traffic or anything, which I think is also helped by the lack of weight. Overall, I very much enjoy driving it, and would recommend it to other buyers looking for an affordable, gas saving car."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Car   Its handles great, breaks are great. Acceleration is tricky when the air is on. The cup holders rattle when they are out. my interior is awesome cause its kind of polka dot gray with blue dots! FUN TO DRIVE!! Great Gas mileage 35-45 mpgs"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"A Great Car To Drive   The acceleration is great, goes from 0-60 in hold on tightly.. it brakes very well and has no problem doing 60 around a corner most cars need to slow down to 45 to do. Hasn't needed any repairs to it and is great on gas, it is just an awesome car and can handle a 6'5 guy in it with room for his legs and thats saying something for a sub-compact."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Toyota Yaris   its very comfortable.Speed is quiet well. i can't satisfied about the acceleration. Handling and braking are almost ok.Easy to maintain.its not fun to drive this car.because I like sporty cars.This is good for family transportation.We can save more fuel.No resent repairs.But the body parts are not enough strong.

2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris Hatchback 2008   Handling and braking are great, cost effectively, wish had more HP under the hood though. Build quality is fine, the frame feels very stiff. I like the looks inside and outside. Requires low maintenance, but it's almost new... Milage is great but the best part, it's a fun car to drive when you get the hang of it. Very soft clutch and gear box. Very comfortable to drive having a Manual Transmition."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Uber Pwnage   Car accelerates excellent... drives like a sports car... tiny very fuel efficient ... overall a great car... didn't think id like it it grew on me... have many great drives like... u can ask about the pizza incident ... that was great
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Hutterite Hatchback   Great little commuter car. Don't like the transmission (automatic). With the car's electric throttle and slushbox, this thing shifts at weird times on hard acceleration or when passing cars... was not fun on road trip. Decent room inside of car though... great for in the city."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris   I rented the base model (two-door) for one day. I know Yaris comes with hatchback version and a sedan version. It runs pretty well, saves gas, even able to make U-turn in a narrow street (not K-turns). Parking alongside the street, sure, is not a problem. Great for city-driving."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,My Baby My Yaris   Oh Man what can I say about this car except it accelerates like a dream sounds like a race car brakes and handles so well so fun to drive have had no problems with it at all its fantastic yeah
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris   good for gas millage. good for long road tips to wherever you want to go. Good for parking, because it can turn really tightly. It can fit into really small spaces. it dents real easy though. Oh and get new tires, because the ones that come with it suck."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Good For Everyone   Lots of room with 40 miles per gallon. Seats five comfortably. 8 cup holders. Easy maintenance. Very peppy and great in traffic. overall a great car to own. Also very nicely priced. I got mine for 13,000. Stands out in the looks department"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Try To Buy Another If You Have Money   it is a very good car for companys. it is very weak & not good at all in traveling. But it is good choice for has a little money. it is the best car if you compare it with the same level of the cars models. it is good to drive it in the downtown buy not in the highway.
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Tiny Monster   Acceleration is ok for 1300 CC, Light, not that low, very agile and looks amazing from the outside and inside. j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Car For Someone With A Low Budget.   car is spacious and lots of room for stuff. great gas mileage. little weak uphills and passing on highway. built very well, toyota so you know it's good. quick and handles good in the city. 2door has lots of leg room in the back. overall a good vehicle."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Great Car For Commuting And Very Adorable.   It's super cute, great mileage and relatively low priced. Acceleration is not very good, but it is only a little 4 cylinder. It handles pretty well and breaks are fine. It is fun to drive although it takes a heavy foot on the gas to get it going."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Toyota Yaris Only For Indian   low performance car/economic car/low stabilty/no fun/apperance can be accepted/not perfect brake/not stable at high speed/interior it is ok/maintenace it is normal comarisson to toyto/easy handling /no need space for barking/acceleration very low special upword direction
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Yaris Hb 2008   No power at all, unless no AC No need for much repair very poor or appearance from inside since it is weak car, you need to push more gas, mean more consuming. it has a small body you will have fun driving it"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,The Yaris In Sudan   Not the best engine in the planet a 1.3L....Well they could have put a bigger engine say a 1.8 or 2.0 cause the braking is really good. The steering is sharp and the ride is acceptable but the engine is the biggest problem with this car but overall defenetly a great every day car.
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Suprise Surprise!   I didn't expect this new Yaris 1.4 D-4D to be so good. It behaves well and does everything nicely. The handling is solid and fool proof. The thing brakes well with a nice pedal feel. The Toyota build quality is preceded by its reputation which it does honour. I quite like the futuristic virtual dashboard, although the rev counter readability could be improved in my opinion. Then we come to the engine: a 1.4 diesel. I know this engine from the Mini One D first generation where it produced a sluggish 75bhp. The evolved engine in the Yaris is a day and night difference from what I can recollect from the Mini. It's lively, powerful in the low & mid range and actually revs up without stepping on its breath too soon. I didn't feel underpowered at all. Very well done Toyota!"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Love My Yaris   It took me a lot of time to decide on a car. One thing I wanted was great gas mileage. I finally decided on the Toyota Yaris. It is the perfect car for me. For a small car it is extremely roomy and has a large trunk. The performance is more than I expected and I average 38 MPG. It took a little while to get use to the dash controls being in the center of the dash instead of over the steering wheel but that is okay now. It I had to do it again I would buy the Yaris...Toyota quality cannot be beat!
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Almost Makes You Miss The Echo.   just terrible. it does not handle well, despite what others say. the engine lacks power, even for an economy car. fuel economy is not that impressive- the car i took on a test drive was averaging a mere 26 mpg, unimpressive for this class. i don't know why i come back to toyota, they just aren't as good as they used to be. anyone interested in this car- i strongly urge you to look elsewhere."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Worst Car On The Road.   This was the worst car I've ever driven. I strongly urge anyone wanting this car to reconsider. It had no power, and if one gets hit by a truck in this car, one should just dig a hole in the ground and bury the car. It is a mobile coffin."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"A Great Subcompact Effort By Toyota   The Toyota Yaris is one of the more common Japanese cars I drive at work, fortunately it is a good one. The Yaris hatch and sedan both drive exactly the same, their only differences are size, options and practicality. The sedan is longer but has no equipment in base form. The hatch is shorter in length, the 3-door is also poorly equipped but the 5-door is well equipped. The Yaris is a surprising car from Toyota, its a fun car to drive from a company normally slammed for producing boring cars. The Yaris handles quite well and is fun despite its slightly overboosted power steering. Fuel economy on this car is excellent, most efficient car I drive at work. Power is really its biggest weak point on performance, the 106 hp engine does move it well in city speeds but is lacking on higher speed highways. Interior on the Yaris could be better. Its not the nicest interior but its also not the worst in its class. Both Yarises have good interior spacing for passengers despite being small. The dash indicators are all located in the center, this does disturb some people. Overall you get what you paid for, one of the most economical cars on the market that happens to be fun with a good badge."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,The Baby Car!   Amazing car. So many memories already as the jelly bean and the baby car. The turning radius is amazing and it fits a unique personality. You can get into any spot and you don't look like one of those ridiculous smart cars. It is extremely inexpensive for what you get and fun to drive because you can manuever anywhere and also know you aren't guzzling gas. With all the essentials and the ability to seat 5 people in a car that gets about 35mpg without being a hybrid is pretty amazing. I love this car and recommend it to someone looking a an inexpensive hyper miler.
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Review   Good Handling, Fuel Efficient, Cheap, Fun to drive, Can be cute in appearance, also can definitely be a monster on the road. First few shifts are quick, it gets a bit slow later on a very light car, beware of high-speed wind when driving fast looks small but its actually bigger than you thought inside"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Awesome Little Econobox   I have a background in performance cars - I used to own a supercharged BMW and a twin turbo RX7. The Yaris is incredible fun to drive. Handles like a go-cart, and can do twisty mountain roads exceptionally well, despite being FWD. It only packs a 1500cc four-banger putting down 106 HP, but it only weighs 2000 pounds. It'll run a 16 second quarter mile with no modification, which means in practice that it can keep up with most stock Mustangs and Camaros pretty well. In the twisties, it handles as well as my BMW or Mazda did any day, which in practice, means I pass most people on mountain roads with no problems. It gets better: with the worst possible driving for economy - going as fast as possible and WOT as often as possible, it still gets 35 MPG. The car is inexpensive to buy (around $10,000), and with a little effort can get 45 MPG, making it inexpensive at the pump. In terms of utility, the car has more nooks and crannies to stash things than any other car - ever. With the possible exception of the VW Passat (umbrellas in the doors?). The Yaris can seriously carry as much as most small pickup trucks or SUVs. Or, it can carry 4 adults with luggage in comfort. The car is a Toyota, and feels well built. Toyota is renowned for reliability, and with a little care, I feel confident that this car will last a VERY long time. My only real complaint is that the driver seating position is a little van-like - I feel like I should be a little closer to the ground."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Practical Car   Very Smooth on roads, Stability is ok. Car's Trunk is very big. 456 Ltr. Very Powerful Automatic. Very comfortable in travelling. its cost is not hight compared by its options. all colors are gr8 has very good maintenance centers, they are very helful and so friendly. as general it is good car"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Yaris 08   I don't like the back. I love the front, it's pretty quick, good braking powers. It is small yet still very spacious. It gets 40 or 44 mpg can't remember. It's very fun to drive. I mean i love my car so There you go! It might be spacious but you can't fit everyone in there. 2 people could fit perfectly in the back, and if you need to add an extra person in the back, which would make 3 make them skinny, seriously! It cost 15000 and then financed cost me 20000. I have warranty on it, i have everything."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,My Little Yaris   The handling is impeccable and is so smooth that you almost can't feel the road. Its very little so any kind of collision and your gonna be basically totaled. It is very fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder it FLIES! The sound system is everything beyond factory sound. I have so many people ask if there is a system in it! I get nearly 40 miles to the gallon and right now it only costs $40.00 to fill it up from empty. Maintenance is VERY low. It even lets you know if the air pressure in your tires is low.
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"2008 Toyota Yaris   When I bought the Yaris I tested out a couple of other economy cars, but the Toyota Yaris was far more appealing. The engine is snappy, the automatic transmission is highly responsive, the I-pod hook up is a great option, and the fuel efficiency is great as well. It still gets comments from people about how cute it is, and questions about the mileage (avg. 35-38). My only complaint about the car is that because it has a nice entry height/ground clearance (5.5""), it doesn't have the best cornering ability. I am willing to deal with the compromised cornering in order to get in and out of it with ease. It is also easy for my disabled mother/grandmother to get in and out of. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants snappy, inexpensive, feature packed, comfortable, and unique looking vehicle"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Yaris   Good reliability, accleration is poor but it only has a 1298cc engine, doesn't rattle and holds corners well, ugly to look at though, u can get nearly 400miles out of a tank of fuel if driven sensibly, not bad for a little run around or a second family car as it will last you at least 200,000miles"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Eto Orangy Yaris Rs 08   Peppy little Yaris RS runs 670 km per tank! With the lowering kit that provides great grip for cornering and is so much fun to drive. I love the look the most and its sharp Orange copper colour wraps with body kit and a Rally style spoiler (The only RS with this spoiler in Calgary)! The interior is very detailed with driver and passenger's needs. You've got to love the amazing storage room within this little egg cell!! Of course it wasn't made for racing purpose or esle it would have been a sport coupe that costs $50 ish a tank and runs 500 km if ur lucky. Future mods (If I still have it and want to buy it ou after 4 years): Supercharge it, dress it up nicer, and making it brighter."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Yarissss   My car has been specialized to my needs so I have no complaints! It is very fuel efficient which is important especially right now with the price of gas!! It handles well even in the winter and I like the look and cut. I have the sedan so it is very roomy...I can even fit my bike in the trunk and close it (the front wheel comes off of my bike) also the back seats are comfortable even for long trips! enough leg room :)
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"Saves Big Money On Gas!   This car is bigger than it appears. Offers plenty of room inside for a family of four. Engine is peppy and has sufficient power for any application. Handling is sharp, precise, and downright fun. Build quality is what one would expect from Toyota...perfect. The simple thing is...this car gets over 30 mpg in the city with the E10 blended fuel. On the highway it gets closer to 40 mpg!"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,Quick Corner Car. Ha   Its under powered but so light that you hardly realize you aren't going that fast. Taking corners is the funnest part. The car just sticks. It's just a fun cheap car to drive.
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"If You're Not Racing, N U Don't Care How Cool You Look, U Can't Pick A Better Car   Fuel mileage is amazing, I've never seen a car with even half as many genius compartments and REALLY WORKING cup holders in my life and I've been in lotsa minivans, quite accurate responsive steering accelerates not bad, peppy engine revs up to 6500rpm redline almost instantly, but low power output makes it pretty boring if u want to drive crazy, feels soooo solid, no squeaks or rattles or vibrations whatsover and feels as sound-insulated as the luxury cars I've been in. Isn't even tiny on the inside at all for the passengers, just the trunk space is small."
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"As Good As A Mini Cooper, I Call The A Japanese Mini   sometime if you want something that save gas and sporty and easy to drive, get this, worth your money, but remember, its kinda slow, so add a supercharger, it will be fun"
2008,Toyota ,Yaris,"It's Got My Back   Its not fast, its not fun and it sure aint good looking, but this car has kept me on the road with basically no problems for four years now. Costs are low and it can handle motorways with ease, unlike the clio which didn't have the engine. Not flashy, but under mine and my brothers care it's done 10000 miles with just a puncture and a new set of brake pads (which I did myself)."
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,Basic Transportation   Reliable and drives with little care. Basic pos that goes quick. Do not crash it this was expensive to fix. No frills reliable expensive transportation. That you can drive and not carry anything inside. Will hols adult and two kids. Thank you. Ery much
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,Great For Communting.   I bought this car to commute. It is great for commuting and is great on gas. I was getting 36 mpg and driving 80 miles round trip 5 days a week. No maintenance issues and all I had to do was clean out the air filter and get the oil changed and tires rotated.
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"Very Good Car Rating   Performance: Very Good (1500 CC, 102 HP, VVTi Engine Tehnology) Build Quality: Excellent (So Light) (fast speesds in windy environment is not recomended) Appearence: Very Good (Stunning Interiors) Cost: Cheap (EGP 80,000+) (it saves a lot of fuel) Fun Factor: yes"

2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"Very Good Car If You Don't Care About Having A Flashy Car.   Build Quality- Should be 5 stars, but app won't let me click it. Performance- It's a nice little car that handles very nicely. Cost of Ownership- Very cheap, I've had no maintenance done on it, and it has very good mileage."
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"Very Good Car For All Types (even Standard) Was Very Nippy   the performance well i would say the torque in this car is suprisingly good for a newly made car, the braking is immense extremely good! handling though not so good it does really stick to the road its kind of tanky lol everything else is brilliant appearence is quite smart and doesnt look like an egg lol interior wise its got all you need gadgets wise even if you dont pay the extra :) gas mileage i would say i can comfortably do 100 miles to £10 which is very good actually because i taz about all the time of an evening and in the day go to work :) i have never had a problem with it since i brought it mechanical wise :) (cross fingers) overall i think its a fab car to drive really fun, comfortable & not embarrassing LOL x"
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"Toyota Yaris, Limited Special Onyx   All in all, a great car. I love it, it handles incredibly well, and although I feel it is slightly lacking in the engine department, it more than makes up for in gas mileage. I would recommend this car to anybody."
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"Excellent Car For City-drivers But Also Non-city, Beautiful And Really Well Made.

2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"The Yaris   i like this car because its solid. it has a great build quality and its relaly compact. what i rellly love is that it can fir for grown people with ease. its also all about the rpm's so this car boogies. there is also a lot of storage. that is a big plus for a car this small. its also really efficient on gas. a couple of things i dont like. the windows must be rolled up by hand, the air pressure in the cabin sometimes show up, the seats dont have the 40-60 split. everything else is great"
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"A Solid, Sporty Car   I just bought the 2009 Yaris, a few months ago.It had 18 miles on it, and now has 3,300. I have noticed the more I drive it, the more the Power, and Pep DEFINITLY pick up. After the first 500 miles, to my Surprise, the Acceleration improved greatly, the turns are tight, and the Breaking is clean, & strong. Gentle pressure is all that is needed. The Interior is more than enough as far as Leg room, because of the movable front seats. and Cargo area is nice. I put the 2 back seats down & keep it that way. I can load groceries, carry tools, Lunches... I threw in a Blanket, and cover up things such as Magazines, Flashlight, etc. Gas mpg runs 34 in city 37-39 on Freeways. And I have had no problems with Squeaking or Rattling with this car. All of this, and I still get Compliments from strangers. It is one of the best cars I have owned {from Ford, to Chevrolet}-- and would recommend the Yaris to anyone who wants Fun, Style, & Reliability."
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,Laura's Yaris   I love this car. It handles really well. I got it with the 5 -speed manual transmission. I have put over 105 miles on it and the gas gauge has barely moved. It is so much fun to drive. I am looking to get a betty boop shifter knob for it now. LOL
2009,Toyota ,Yaris,"$13000 Cheap On Gas Tires And .insurance.... Save Your Money Buy A House...lol   Performance - acceleration fair, braking better than average, handling good Build Quality - No problems from what i can see and hear.
